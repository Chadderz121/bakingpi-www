					The OK01 lesson contains an explanation about how to get started and teaches how
					to enable the 'OK' or 'ACT' <strong title="Light Emitting Diode">LED</strong> on the Raspberry
					Pi board near the RCA and USB ports. This light was originally labelled OK but has been renamed to ACT on the revision
					2 Raspberry Pi boards.

					1 Getting Started</h2>
				<p>
					I am assuming at this point that you have already visited the <a href="downloads.html">
						Downloads</a> page, and got the necessary GNU Toolchain. Also on the downloads
					page is a file called OS Template. Please download this and extract its contents
					to a new directory.
				</p>
				<h2 id="beginning">
					2 The Beginning</h2>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>
					The '.s' file extension is commonly used for all forms of assembly code, it is up
					to us to remember this is ARMv6.</p></div>
				<p>
					Now that you have extracted the template, create a new file in the 'source' directory
					called 'main.s'. This file will contain the code for this operating system. To be explicit, the folder structure should look like:</p>
					<pre class="pseudoCodeBlock">build/
   <em>(empty)</em>
source/
   main.s
kernel.ld
LICENSE
Makefile</pre>
				<p>
					Open 'main.s' in a text editor so that we can begin typing assembly code. The Raspberry Pi
					uses a variety of assembly code called ARMv6, so that is what we'll need to write
					in.</p>
				<p>
					Copy in these first commands.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					.section .init<br />
					.globl _start<br />
					_start:<br />
				</p></div>
				<p>
					As it happens, none of these actually do anything on the Raspberry Pi, these are
					all instructions to the assembler. The assembler is the program that will translate
					between assembly code that we understand, and binary machine code that the Raspberry
					Pi understands. In Assembly Code, each line is a new command. The first line here
					tells the Assembler<a class="noteLink" name="note1a" href="#note1" title="Note 1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
					where to put our code. The template I provided causes the code in the section called
					<span class="armCodeInline">.init</span> to be put at the start of the output. This
					is important, as we want to make sure we can control which code runs first. If we
					don't do this, the code in the alphabetically first file name will run first! The
					<span class="armCodeInline">.section</span> command simply tells the assembler which
					section to put the code in, from this point until the next <span class="armCodeInline">
						.section</span> or the end of the file.</p>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>
					In assembly code, you may skip lines, and put spaces before and after commands to
					aid readability.</p></div>
				<p>
					The next two lines are there to stop a warning message and aren't all that important.<a
						class="noteLink" href="#note2" name="note2a" title="Note 2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
				<h2 id="firstline">
					3 The First Line</h2>
				<p>
					Now we're actually going to code something. In assembly code, the computer simply
					goes through the code, doing each instruction in order, unless told otherwise. Each
					instruction starts on a new line.</p>
				<p>
					Copy the following instruction.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					ldr r0,=0x20200000
				</p>
				<p>
					For the Raspberry Pi 2b the peripheral base register has changed.<br>
					Copy the following instruction for that model.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					ldr r0,=0x3f200000
				</p></div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">ldr reg,=val</span> puts the number <span class="armCodeInline">
						val</span> into the register named <span class="armCodeInline">reg</span>.</p></div>
				<p>
					That is our first command. It tells the processor to store the number 0x20200000 respectively 0x3f200000
					into the register r0. I shall need to answer two questions here, what is a register,
					and how is 0x20200000 a number?</p>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>
					A single register can store any integer between 0 and 4,294,967,295 inclusive on
					the Raspberry Pi, which might seem like a large amount of memory, but it is only
					32 binary bits.
				</p></div>
				<p>
					A register is a tiny piece of memory in the processor, which is where the processor
					stores the numbers it is working on right now. There are quite a few of these, many
					of which have a special meaning, which we will come to later. Importantly there
					are 13 (named r0,r1,r2,...,r9,r10,r11,r12) which are called General Purpose, and
					you can use them for whatever calculations you need to do. Since it's the first,
					I've used r0 in this example, but I could very well have used any of the others.
					As long as you're consistent, it doesn't matter.</p>
				<p>
					0x20200000 is indeed a number. However it is written in Hexadecimal notation. To
					learn more about hexadecimal expand the box below:</p>
				<div class="expandableHeader" onclick="return ExpandToggle('hex')">
					<p>
						<a class="icon-more">Hexadecimal explained</a></p>
				</div>
				<div id="hex" class="expandable">
					<p>
						Hexadecimal is an alternate system for writing numbers. You may only be aware of
						the decimal system for writing numbers in which we have 10 digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
						and 9. Hexadecimal is a system with 16 digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e and
						f.</p>
					<img src="images/hexadecimal1.png" alt="567 is 5 hundreds, 6 tens and 7 units."
						class="sideDiagram" />
					<p>
						You may recall being taught how decimal numbers work in terms of place value. We
						say that the rightmost digits is the 'units' digits, the next one left is the 'tens'
						digit, the next is the 'hundreds' digit, and so on. What this actually meant is,
						the number is 100 &times; the value in the 'hundreds' digit, plus 10 &times; the
						value in the 'tens' digit, plus 1 &times; the value in the units digit.</p>
					<img src="images/hexadecimal2.png" alt="567 is 5x10^2+6x10^1+7x10^0" class="sideDiagram" />
					<p>
						More mathematically, we can now spot the pattern and say that the rightmost digit
						is the 10<sup>0</sup>=1s digit, the next left is the 10<sup>1</sup>=10s digit, the
						next is 10<sup>2</sup>=100s digit, and so on. We have all agreed on the system that
						0 is the lowest digit, 1 is the next and so on. But what if we used a different
						number instead of 10 in these powers? Hexadecimal is just the system in which we
						use 16 instead.</p>
					<img src="images/hexadecimal3.png" alt="567 = 5x10^2+6x10^1+7x10^0 = 2x16^2+3x16^1+7x16^0"
						class="sideDiagram" />
					<p>
						The mathematics to the right shows that the number 567 in decimal is equivalent
						to the number 237 in hexadecimal. Often when we need to be clear about what system
						we're using to write numbers in we put <sub>10</sub> for decimal and <sub>16</sub>
						for hexadecimal. Since it's difficult to write small numbers in assembly code, we
						use 0x instead to represent a number in hexadecimal notation. So 0x237 means 237<sub>16</sub>.</p>
					<p>
						So where do a,b,c,d,e and f come in? Well, in order to be able to write every number
						in hexadecimal, we need extra digits. For example 9<sub>16</sub> = 9&times;16<sup>0</sup>
						= 9<sub>10</sub>, but 10<sub>16</sub> = 1&times;16<sup>1</sup> + 1&times;16<sup>0</sup>
						= 16<sub>10</sub>. So if we just used 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 we would not be able
						to write 10<sub>10</sub>, 11<sub>10</sub>, 12<sub>10</sub>, 13<sub>10</sub>, 14<sub>10</sub>,
						15<sub>10</sub>. So we introduce 6 new digits such that a<sub>16</sub> = 10<sub>10</sub>,
						b<sub>16</sub> = 11<sub>10</sub>, c<sub>16</sub> = 12<sub>10</sub>, d<sub>16</sub>
						= 13<sub>10</sub>, e<sub>16</sub> = 14<sub>10</sub>, f<sub>16</sub> = 15<sub>10</sub></p>
					<p>
						So, we now have another system for writing numbers. But why did we bother? Well,
						it turns out that since computers always work in binary, hexadecimal notation is
						very useful because every hexadecimal digit is exactly four binary digits long.
						This has the nice side effect that a lot of computer numbers are round numbers in
						hexadecimal, even though they're not in decimal. For example, in the assembly code
						just above I used the number 20200000<sub>16</sub>. If I had chose to write this
						in decimal it would have been 538968064<sub>10</sub>, which is much less memorable.
					</p>
					<p>
						To convert numbers from decimal to hexadecimal I find the following method easiest:</p>
					<img src="images/hexadecimal4.png" alt="Conversion example" class="sideDiagram" />
					<ol>
						<li>Start with the decimal number, say 567.</li>
						<li>Divide by 16 and calculate the remainder. For example 567 &divide; 16 = 35 remainder
							7.</li>
						<li>The remainder is the last digit of the answer in hexadecimal, in the example this
							is 7.</li>
						<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 again with the result of the last division until the result
							is 0. For example 35 &divide; 16 = 2 remainder 3, so 3 is the next digit of the
							answer. 2 &divide; 16 = 0 remainder 2, so 2 is the next digit of the answer.</li>
						<li>Once the result of the division is 0, you can stop. The answer is just the remainders
							in the reverse order to which you got them, so 567<sub>10</sub> = 237<sub>16</sub>.</li></ol>
					<p>
						To convert hexadecimal numbers back to decimal, it is easiest to expand out the
						number, so 237<sub>16</sub> = 2&times;16<sup>2</sup> + 3&times;16<sup>1</sup> +7
						&times;16<sup>0</sup> = 2&times;256 + 3&times;16 + 7&times;1 = 512 + 48 + 7 = 567.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					So our first command is to put the number 20200000<sub>16</sub> into r0. That doesn't
					sound like it would be much use, but it is. In computers, there are an awful lot
					of chunks of memory and devices. In order to access them all, we give each one an
					address. Much like a postal address or a web address this is just a means of identifying
					the location of the device or chunks of memory we want. Addresses in computers are
					just numbers, and so the number 20200000<sub>16</sub> happens to be the address
					of the GPIO controller. This is just a design decision taken by the manufacturers,
					they could have used any other address (providing it didn't conflict with anything
					else). I know this address only because I looked it up in a manual<a class="noteLink"
						name="note3a" href="#note3" title="Note 3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, there is no particular
					system to the addresses (other than that they are all large round numbers in hexadecimal).</p>

					4 Enabling Output</h2>
				<img src="images/gpioController.png" alt="A diagram showing key parts of the GPIO controller."
					class="marginDiagram" />
				<p>
					Having read the manual, I know we're going to need to send two messages to the GPIO
					controller. We need to talk its language, but if we do, it will obligingly do what
					we want and turn on the OK LED. Fortunately, it is such a simple chip, that it only
					needs a few numbers in order to understand what to do.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					mov r1,#1<br />
					lsl r1,#18<br />
					str r1,[r0,#4]<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					For the Raspberry Pi Model 2b there are again slight changes.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					mov r1,#1<br />
					lsl r1,#21<br />
					str r1,[r0,#16]<br />
				</p></div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">mov reg,#val</span> puts the number <span class="armCodeInline">
						val</span> into the register named <span class="armCodeInline">reg</span>.</p></div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">lsl reg,#val</span> shifts the binary representation
					of the number in <span class="armCodeInline">reg</span> by <span class="armCodeInline">
						val</span> places to the left.</p></div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">str reg,[dest,#val]</span> stores the number in <span
						class="armCodeInline">reg</span> at the address given by <span class="armCodeInline">
							dest</span> + <span class="armCodeInline">val</span>.</p></div>
				<p>
					These commands enable output to the 16th GPIO pin. First we get a necessary value
					in r1, then send it to the GPIO controller. Since the first two instructions are
					just trying to get a value into r1, we could use another <span class="armCodeInline">
						ldr</span> command as before, but it will be useful to us later to be able to
					set any given GPIO pin, so it is better to deduce the value from a formula than
					write it straight in. The OK LED is wired to the 16th GPIO pin or respectively the 47thGPIO pin for the RP 2b, and so we need to
					send a command to enable the 16th/47th pin.</p>
				<p>
					The value in r1 is needed to enable the LED pin. The first line puts the number
					1<sub>10</sub> into r1. The <span class="armCodeInline">mov</span> command is faster
					than the <span class="armCodeInline">ldr</span> command, because it does not involve
					a memory interaction, whereas <span class="armCodeInline">ldr</span> loads the value
					we want to put into the register from memory. However, <span class="armCodeInline">mov</span>
					can only be used to load certain values<a class="noteLink" name="note4a" href="#note4"
						title="Note 4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. In ARM assembly code, almost every instruction
					begins with a three letter code. This is called the mnemonic, and is supposed to
					hint at what the operation does. <span class="armCodeInline">mov</span> is short
					for move and <span class="armCodeInline">ldr</span> is short for load register.
					<span class="armCodeInline">mov</span> moves the second argument <span class="armCodeInline">
						#1</span> into the first <span class="armCodeInline">r1</span>. In general,
					<span class="armCodeInline">#</span> must be used to denote numbers, but we have
					already seen a counterexample to this.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second instruction is <span class="armCodeInline">lsl</span> or logical shift
					left. This means shift the binary representation for the first argument left by
					the second argument. In this case this will shift the binary representation of 1<sub>10</sub>
					(which is 1<sub>2</sub>) left by 18 places (making it 1000000000000000000<sub>2</sub>=262144<sub>10</sub>).</p>

				</div>
				<div id="binary" class="expandable">
					<p>
						Just like hexadecimal binary is another way of writing numbers. In binary we only
						have 2 digits, 0 and 1. This is useful for computers because we can implement this
						in a circuit by saying that electricity flowing through the circuit means 1, and
						not means 0. This is how computers actually work and do maths. Despite only having
						2 digits binary can still be used to represent every number, it just takes a lot
						longer.</p>
					<img src="images/binary1.png" alt="567 in decimal = 1000110111 in binary" class="sideDiagram" />
					<p>
						The image shows the binary representation of the number 567<sub>10</sub> which is
						1000110111<sub>2</sub>. We use <sub>2</sub> to denote numbers written in binary.</p>
					<p>
						One of the quirks of binary that we make heavy use of in assembly code is the ease
						by which numbers can be multiplied or divided by powers of 2 (e.g. 1,2,4,8,16).
						Normally multiplications and divisions are tricky operations, however these special
						cases are very easy, and so are very important.</p>
					<img src="images/binary2.png" alt="13*4 = 52, 1101*100=110100" class="sideDiagram" />
					<p>
						Shifting a binary number left by <strong>n</strong> places is the same as multiplying
						the number by 2<sup><strong>n</strong></sup>. So, if we want to multiply by 4, we
						just shift the number left 2 places. If we want to multiply by 256 we could shift
						it left by 8 places. If we wanted to multiply by a number like 12, we could instead
						multiply it by 8, then separately by 4 and add the results (N &times; 12 = N &times;
						(8 + 4) = N &times; 8 + N &times; 4).</p>
					<img src="images/binary3.png" alt="53/16 = 3, 110100/10000=11" class="sideDiagram" />
					<p>
						Shifting a binary number right by <strong>n</strong> places is the same as dividing
						the number by 2<sup><strong>n</strong></sup>. The remainder of the division is the
						bits that were lost when shifted right. Unfortunately dividing by a binary number
						that is not an exact power of 2 is very difficult, and will be covered in <a href="screen04.html">
							Lesson 9: Screen04</a>.</p>
					<img src="images/binary4.png" alt="Binary Terminology" class="sideDiagram" />
					<p>
						This diagram shows common terminology used with binary. A bit is a single binary
						digit. A nibble is 4 binary bits. A byte is 2 nibbles, or 8 bits. A half is half
						the size of a word, 2 bytes in this case. A word refers to the size of the registers
						on a processor, and so on the Raspberry Pi this is 4 bytes. The convention is to
						number the most significant bit of a word 31, and the least significant bit as 0.
						The top, or high bits refer to the most significant bits, and the low or bottom
						bits refer to the least significant. A kilobyte (KB) is 1000 bytes, a megabyte is
						1000 KB. There is some confusion as to whether this should be 1000 or 1024 (a round
						number in binary). As such, the new international standard is that a KB is 1000
						bytes, and a Kibibyte (KiB) is 1024 bytes. A Kb is 1000 bits, and a Kib is 1024
						bits.</p>
					<p>
						The Raspberry Pi is little endian by default, meaning that loading a byte from an
						address you just wrote a word to will load the lowest byte of the word.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Once again, I only know that we need this value from reading the manual<a class="noteLink"
						name="note3b" href="#note3" title="Note 3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. The manual says
					that there is a set of 24 bytes in the GPIO controller, which determine the settings
					of the GPIO pin. The first 4 relate to the first 10 GPIO pins, the second 4 relate
					to the next 10 and so on. There are 54 GPIO pins, so we need 6 sets of 4 bytes,
					which is 24 bytes in total. Within each 4 byte section, every 3 bits relates to
					a particular GPIO pin. Since we want the 16th GPIO pin, we need the second set of
					4 bytes because we're dealing with pins 10-19, and we need the 6th set of 3 bits,
					which is where the number 18 (6&times;3) comes from in the code above.<br><br>
					For the RP 2b respectively we need the following:<br>
					We want the 47th GPIO pin. Therefore we need the fourth set of 4 bytes (Pins 40-49), 
					starting at  #16. And we need the 7th set of 3 bits, where the number 21 comes from 
					(7&times;3).</p>
				<p>
					Finally the <span class="armCodeInline">str</span> 'store register' command stores
					the value in the first argument, <span class="armCodeInline">r1</span> into the
					address computed from the expression afterwards. The expression can be a register,
					in this case <span class="armCodeInline">r0</span>, which we know to be the GPIO
					controller address, and another value to add to it, in this case <span class="armCodeInline">
						#4</span>. This means we add 4 to the GPIO controller address and write the
					value in <span class="armCodeInline">r1</span> to that location. This happens to
					be the location of the second set of 4 bytes that I mentioned before, and so we
					send our first message to the GPIO controller, telling it to ready the 16th GPIO
					pin for output.</p>
				<h2 id="signlife">
					5 A Sign Of Life</h2>
				<p>
					Now that the LED is ready to turn on, we need to actually turn it on. This means
					sending a message to the GPIO controller to turn pin 16 off. Yes, <em>turn it off</em>.
					The chip manufacturers decided it made more sense<a class="noteLink" name="note5a"
						href="#note5" title="Note 5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> to have the LED turn on when
					the GPIO pin is off. Hardware engineers often seem to take these sorts of decisions,
					seemingly just to keep OS Developers on their toes. Consider yourself warned.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					mov r1,#1<br />
					lsl r1,#16<br />
					str r1,[r0,#40]<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					For the Raspberry Pi 2b things change again slightly.
					This time we need to turn pin 47 on and NOT off.</p>
					<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					mov r1,#1<br />
					lsl r1,#15<br />
					str r1,[r0,#32]<br />
				</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Hopefully you should recognise all of the above commands, if not their values. The
					first puts a 1 into <span class="armCodeInline">r1</span> as before. The second
					shifts the binary representation of this 1 left by 16 places. Since we want to turn
					pin 16 off, we need to have a 1 in the 16th bit of this next message (other values
					would work for other pins). Finally we write it out to the address which is 40<sub>10</sub>
					added to the GPIO controller address, which happens to be the address to write to
					turn a pin off (28 would turn the pin on).<br><br>
					For the RP 2b we have to shift the 1 left by 15 since this is the result of modulus 47 of 32.
					Furthermore we need write it out to the adress which is 32<sub>10</sub>
					added to the GPIO controller address, which is address to write to
					turn a pin on for a RP 2b.</p>
				<h2 id="happy">
					6 Happily Ever After</h2>
				<p>
					It might be tempting to finish now, but unfortunately the processor doesn't know
					we're done. In actuality, the processor never will stop. As long as it has power,
					it continues working. Thus, we need to give it a task to do forever more, or the
					Raspberry Pi will crash (not much of a problem in this example, the light is already
					on).</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					loop$:
					<br />
					b loop$<br />
					<br />
				</p></div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">name:</span> labels the next line <span class="armCodeInline">
						name</span>.</p></div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">b label</span> causes the next line to be executed to
					be <span class="armCodeInline">label</span>.</p></div>
				<p>
					The first line here is not a command, but a label. It names the next line <span class="armCodeInline">
						loop$</span>. This means we can now refer to the line by name. This is called
					a label. Labels get discarded when the code is turned into binary, but they're useful
					for our benefit for referring to lines by name, not number (address). By convention
					we use a <span class="armCodeInline">$</span> for labels which are only important
					to the code in this block of code, to let others know they're not important to the
					overall program. The <span class="armCodeInline">b</span> (branch) command causes
					the next line to be executed to be the one at the label specified, rather than the
					one after it. Therefore, the next line to be executed will be this <span class="armCodeInline">
						b</span>, which will cause it to be executed again, and so on forever. Thus
					the processor is stuck in a nice infinite loop until it is switched off safely.</p>
				<p>
					The new line at the end of the block is intentional. The GNU toolchain expects all
					assembly code files to end in an empty line, so that it is sure you were really
					finished, and the file hasn't been cut off. If you don't put one, you get an annoying
					warning when the assembler runs.</p>
				<h2 id="pitime">
					7 Pi Time</h2>
				<p>
					So we've written the code, now to get it onto the pi. Open a terminal on your computer
					and change the current working directory to the parent directory of the source directory.
					Type <span class="shellCodeInline">make</span> and then press enter. If any errors
					occur, please refer to the troubleshooting section. If not, you will have generated
					three files. kernel.img is the compiled image of your operating system. kernel.list
					is a listing of the assembly code you wrote, as it was actually generated. This
					is useful to check that things were generated correctly in future. The kernel.map
					file contains a map of where all the labels ended up, which can be useful for chasing
					around values.

				<p>
					To install your operating system, first of all get a Raspberry PI SD card which
					has an operating system installed already. If you browse the files in the SD card,
					you should see one called kernel.img. Rename this file to something else, such as
					kernel_linux.img. Then, copy the file kernel.img that <span class="shellCodeInline">
						make</span> generated onto the SD Card. You've just replaced the existing operating
					system with your own. To switch back, simply delete your kernel.img file, and rename
					the other one back to kernel.img. I find it is always helpful to keep a backup of
					you original Raspberry Pi operating system, in case you need it again.</p>
				<p>
					Put the SD card into a Raspberry Pi and turn it on. The OK LED should turn on. If
					not please see the troubleshooting page. If so, congratulations, you just wrote
					your first operating system. See <a href="ok02.html">Lesson 2: OK02</a> for a guide
					to making the LED flash on and off.</p>

					<li><a name="note2" /><sup>[2]<a class="noteBackLink" href="#note2a">^</a></sup> Clearly
						they're important to you. Since the GNU toolchain is mainly used for creating programs,
						it expects there to be an entry point labelled <span class="armCodeInline">_start</span>.
						As we're making an operating system, the <span class="armCodeInline">_start</span>
						is always whatever comes first, which we set up with the <span class="armCodeInline">
							.section .init</span> command. However, if we don't say where the entry point
						is, the toolchain gets upset. Thus, the first line says that we are going to define
						a symbol called <span class="armCodeInline">_start</span> for all to see (globally),
						and the second line says to make the symbol <span class="armCodeInline">_start</span>
						the address of the next line. We will come onto addresses shortly.</li>

							title="Broadcom BCM2835 ARM Peripherals">SoC-Peripherals.pdf</a>. For added
							confusion, the manual uses a different addressing system. An address listed as
							0x7E200000 would be 0x20200000 in our OS.</li>

					<li><a name="note5" /><sup>[5]<a class="noteBackLink" href="#note5a">^</a></sup> A hardware
						engineer was kind enough to explain this to me as follows:
						<p>
							The reason is that modern chips are made of a technology called CMOS, which stands
							for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. The Complementary part means each signal
							is connected to two transistors, one made of material called N-type semiconductor
							which is used to pull it to a low voltage and another made of P-type material to
							pull it to a high voltage. Only one transistor of the pair turns on at any time,
							otherwise we'd get a short circuit. P-type isn't as conductive as N-type, which
							means the P-type transistor has to be about 3 times as big to provide the same current.
							This is why LEDs are often wired to turn on by pulling them low, because the N-type
							is stronger at pulling low than the P-type is in pulling high.
						</p>
						<p>
							There's another reason. Back in the 1970s chips were made out of entirely out of
							N-type material ('NMOS'), with the P-type replaced by a resistor. That means that
							when a signal is pulled low the chip is consuming power (and getting hot) even while
							it isn't doing anything. Your phone getting hot and flattening the battery when
							it's in your pocket doing nothing wouldn't be good. So signals were designed to
							be 'active low' so that they're high when inactive and so don't take any power.
							Even though we don't use NMOS any more, it's still often quicker to pull a signal
							low with the N-type than to pull it high with the P-type. Often a signal that's
							'active low' is marked with a bar over the top of the name, or written as SIGNAL_n
							or /SIGNAL. But it can still be confusing, even for hardware engineers!
