				<p>
					The Input02 lesson builds on Input01, by building a simple command line interface
					where the user can type commands and the computer interprets and displays them.
					It is assumed you have the code for the <a href="input01.html">Lesson 11: Input01</a>
					operating system as a basis.</p>

					1 Terminal 1</h2>
					<div class="informationBox"><p>In the early days of computing, there would usually be one large computer in a building, and many 'terminals' which sent commands to it. The computer would take it in turns to execute different incoming commands.</p></div>
				<p>
					Almost every operating system starts life out as a text terminal. This is typically
					a black screen with white writing, where you type commands for the computer to execute
					on the keyboard, and it explains how you've mistyped them, or very occasionally,
					does what you want. This approach has two main advantages: it provides a simple,
					robust control mechanism for the computer using only a keyboard and monitor, and
					it is done by almost every operating system, so is widely understood by system administrators.</p>
				<p>
					Let's analyse what we want to do precisely:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Computer turns on, displays some sort of welcome message</li>
					<li>Computer indicates its ready for input</li>
					<li>User types a command, with parameters, on the keyboard</li>
					<li>User presses return or enter to commit the command</li>
					<li>Computer interprets command and performs actions if command is acceptable</li>
					<li>Computer displays messages to indicate if command was successful, and also what
						happened</li>
					<li>Loop back to 2</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					One defining feature of such terminals is that they are unified for both input and
					output. The same screen is used to enter inputs as is used to print outputs. This
					means it is useful to build an abstraction of a character based display. In a character
					based display, the smallest unit is a character, not a pixel. The screen is divided
					into a fixed number of characters which have varying colours. We can build this
					on top of our existing screen code, by storing the characters and their colours,
					and then using the DrawCharacter method to push them to the screen. Once we have
					a character based display, drawing text becomes a matter of drawing a line of characters.</p>
				<p>
					In a new file called terminal.s copy the following code:</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock">
					<p>
						.section .data<br />
						.align 4<br />
						terminalStart:<br />
						.int terminalBuffer<br />
						terminalStop:<br />
						.int terminalBuffer<br />
						terminalView:<br />
						.int terminalBuffer<br />
						terminalColour:<br />
						.byte 0xf<br />
						.align 8<br />
						terminalBuffer:<br />
						.rept 128*128<br />
						.byte 0x7f<br />
						.byte 0x0<br />
						.endr<br />
						terminalScreen:<br />
						.rept 1024/8 * 768/16<br />
						.byte 0x7f<br />
						.byte 0x0<br />
						.endr<br />
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					This sets up the data we need for the text terminal. We have two main storages:
					terminalBuffer and terminalScreen. terminalBuffer is storage for all of the text
					we have displayed. It stores up to 128 lines of text (each containing 128 characters).
					Each character consists of an ASCII character code and a colour, all of which are
					initially set to 0x7f (ASCII delete) and 0 (black on a black background). terminalScreen
					stores the characters that are currently displayed on the screen. It is 128 by 48
					characters, similarly initialised. You may think that we only need this terminalScreen,
					not the terminalBuffer, but storing the buffer has 2 main advantages:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>We can easily see which characters are different, so we only have to draw those.</li>
					<li>We can 'scroll' back through the terminal's history because it is stored (to a limit).</li>
				</ol>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>You should always try to design systems that do the minimum amount of work, as they run much faster for things which don't often change.</p></div>
				<p>
					The differing trick is really common on low power Operating Systems. Drawing the
					screen is a slow operation, and so we only want to draw thing that we absolutely
					have to. In this system, we can freely alter the terminalBuffer, and then call a
					method which copies the bits that change to the screen. This means we don't have
					to draw each character as we go along, which may save time in the long run on very
					long sections of text that span many lines.</p>
				<p>
					The other values in the .data section are as follows:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>terminalStart</dt>
					<dd>
						The first character which has been written in terminalBuffer.</dd>
					<dt>terminalStop</dt>
					<dd>
						The last character which has been written in terminalBuffer.</dd>
					<dt>terminalView</dt>
					<dd>
						The first character on the screen at present. We can use this to scroll the screen.</dd>
					<dt>temrinalColour</dt>
					<dd>
						The colour to draw new characters with.</dd>
				</dl>
				<div class="informationBox">
					<p>
						Circular buffers are an example of an <strong>data structure</strong>. These are
						just ideas we have for organising data, that we sometimes implement in software.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					<img alt="Diagram showing hellow world being inserted into a circular buffer of size 5."
						src="images/circular_buffer.png" />
					The reason why terminalStart needs to be stored is because termainlBuffer should
					be a circular buffer. This means that when the buffer is completely full, the end
					'wraps' round to the start, and so the character after the very last one is the
					first one. Thus, we need to advance terminalStart so we know that we've done this.
					When wokring with the buffer this can easily be implemented by checking if the index
					goes beyond the end of the buffer, and setting it back to the beginning if it does.
					Circular buffers are a common and clever way of storing a lot of data, where only
					the most recent data is important. It allows us to keep writing indefinitely, while
					always being sure there is a certain amount of recent data available. They're often
					used in signal processing or compression algorithms. In this case, it allows us
					to store a 128 line history of the terminal, without any penalties for writing over
					128 lines. If we didn't have this, we would have to copy 127 lines back a line very
					time we went beyond the 128th line, wasting valuable time.</p>
				<p>
					I've mentioned the terminalColour here a few times. You can implement this however
					you, wish, however there is something of a standard on text terminals to have only
					16 colours for foreground, and 16 colours for background (meaning there are 16<sup>2</sup>
					= 256 combinations). The colours on a CGA terminal are defined as follows:</p>

				<p>
					We store the colour of each character by storing the fore colour in the low nibble
					of the colour byte, and the background colour in the high nibble. Apart from brown,
					all of these colours follow a pattern such that in binary, the top bit represents
					adding ⅓ to each component, and the other bits represent adding ⅔ to individual
					components. This makes it easy to convert to RGB colour values.</p>
				<p>
					We need a method, TerminalColour, to read these 4 bit colour codes, and then call
					SetForeColour with the 16 bit equivalent. Try to implement this on your own. If
					you get stuck, or have not completed the Screen series, my implementation is given
					below:</p>

					2 Showing the Text</h2>
				<p>
					The first method we really need for our terminal is TerminalDisplay, one that copies
					the current data from terminalBuffer to terminalScreen and the actual screen. As
					mentioned, this method should do a minimal amount of work, because we need to be
					able to call it often. It should compare the text in terminalBuffer with that in
					terminalDisplay, and copy it across if they're different. Remember, terminalBuffer
					is a circular buffer running, in this case, from terminalView to terminalStop or
					128*48 characters, whichever comes sooner. If we hit terminalStop, we'll assume
					all characters after that point are 7f<sub>16</sub> (ASCII delete), and have colour
					0 (black on a black background).</p>
				<p>
					Let's look at what we have to do:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Load in terminalView, terminalStop and the address of terminalDisplay.</li>
					<li>For each row:
						<ol>
							<li>For each column:
								<ol>
									<li>If view is not equal to stop, load the current character and colour from view</li>
									<li>Otherwise load the character as 0x7f and the colour as 0</li>
									<li>Load the current character from terminalDisplay</li>
									<li>If the character and colour are equal, go to 10</li>
									<li>Store the character and colour to terminalDisplay</li>
									<li>Call TerminalColour with the background colour in r0</li>
									<li>Call DrawCharacter with r0 = 0x7f (ASCII delete, a block), r1 = x, r2 = y</li>
									<li>Call TerminalColour with the foreground colour in r0</li>
									<li>Call DrawCharacter with r0 = character, r1 = x, r2 = y</li>
									<li>Increment the position in terminalDisplay by 2</li>
									<li>If view and stop are not equal, increment the view position by 2</li>
									<li>If the view position is at the end of textBuffer, set it to the start</li>
									<li>Increment the x co-ordinate by 8</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Increment the y co-ordinate by 16</li>
						</ol>

					3 Printing Lines</h2>
				<p>
					Now we have our TerminalDisplay method, which will automatically display the contents
					of terminalBuffer to terminalScreen, so theoretically we can draw text. However,
					we don't actually have any drawing routines that work on a character based display.
					A quick method that will come in handy first of all is TerminalClear, which completely
					clears the terminal. This can actually very easily be achieved with no loops. Try
					to deduce why the following method suffices:</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock">
					<p>
						.globl TerminalClear<br />
						TerminalClear:<br />
						ldr r0,=terminalStart<br />
						add r1,r0,#terminalBuffer-terminalStart<br />
						str r1,[r0]<br />
						str r1,[r0,#terminalStop-terminalStart]<br />
						str r1,[r0,#terminalView-terminalStart]<br />
						mov pc,lr<br />
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Now we need to make a basic method for character based displays; the Print function.
					This takes in a string address in r0, and a length in r1, and simply writes it to
					the current location at the screen. There are a few special characters to be wary
					of, as well as special behaviour to ensure that terminalView is kept up to date.
					Let's analyse what it has to do:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Check if string length is 0, if so return</li>
					<li>Load in terminalStop and terminalView</li>
					<li>Deduce the x-coordinate of terminalStop</li>
					<li>For each character:
						<ol>
							<li>Check if the character is a new line</li>
							<li>If so, increment bufferStop to the end of the line storing a black on black delete
								character.</li>
							<li>Otherwise, copy the character in the current terminalColour</li>
							<li>Check if we're at the end of a line</li>
							<li>If so, check if the number of characters between terminalView and terminalStop is
								more than one screen</li>
							<li>If so, increment terminalView by one line</li>
							<li>Check if terminalView is at the end of the buffer, replace it with the start if
								so</li>
							<li>Check if terminalStop is at the end of the buffer, replace it with the start if
								so</li>
							<li>Check if terminalStop equals terminalStart, increment terminalStart by one line
								if so</li>
							<li>Check if terminalStart is at the end of the buffer, replace it with the start if
								so</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Store back terminalStop and terminalView.</li>
				</ol>

					This method allows us to print arbitrary text to the screen. Throughout, I've been
					using the colour variable, but no where have we actually set it. Normally, terminals
					use special combinations of characters to change the colour. For example ASCII Escape
					(1b<sub>16</sub>) followed by a number 0 to f in hexadecimal could set the foreground
					colour to that CGA colour number. You can try implementing this yourself; my version
					is in the further examples section on the download page.</p>
				<h2 id="userinput">
					4 Standard Input</h2>
					<div class="informationBox"><p>By convention, in many programming languages, every program has access
					to stdin and stdout, which are an input and and output stream linked to the terminal. This is still true on
					graphical programs, though many don't use it.</p></div>
				<p>
					Now we have an output terminal that in theory can print out text and display it.
					That is only half the story however, we want input. We want to implement a method,
					ReadLine, which stores the next line of text a user types to a location given in
					r0, up to a maximum length given in r1, and returns the length of the string read
					in r0. The tricky thing is, the user annoyingly wants to see what they're typing
					as they type it, they want to use backspace to delete mistakes and they want to
					use return to submit commands. They probably even want a flashing underscore character
					to indicate the computer would like input! These perfectly reasonable requests make
					this method a real challenge. One way to achieve all of this is to store the text
					they type in memory somewhere along with its length, and then after every character,
					move the terminalStop address back to where it started when ReadLine was called
					and calling Print. This means we only have to be able to manipulate a string in
					memory, and then make use of our Print function.</p>
				<p>
					Lets have a look at what ReadLine will do:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>If the maximum length is 0, return 0</li>
					<li>Retrieve the current values of terminalStop and terminalView</li>
					<li>If the maximum length is bigger than half the buffer size, set it to half the buffer
						size</li>
					<li>Subtract one from maximum length to ensure it can store our flashing underscore
						or a null terminator</li>
					<li>Write an underscore to the string</li>
					<li>Write the stored terminalView and terminalStop addresses back to the memory</li>
					<li>Call Print on the current string</li>
					<li>Call TerminalDisplay</li>
					<li>Call KeyboardUpdate</li>
					<li>Call KeyboardGetChar</li>
					<li>If it is a new line character go to 16</li>
					<li>If it is a backspace character, subtract 1 from the length of the string (if it
						is &gt; 0)</li>
					<li>If it is an ordinary character, write it to the string (if the length &lt; maximum
						length)</li>
					<li>If the string ends in an underscore, write a space, otherwise write an underscore</li>
					<li>Go to 6</li>
					<li>Write a new line character to the end of the string</li>
					<li>Call Print and TerminalDisplay</li>
					<li>Replace the new line with a null terminator</li>
					<li>Return the length of the string</li>
				</ol>

					This code brings everything together into a simple command line operating system.
					The commands available are echo, reset, ok and cls. echo copies any text after it
					back to the terminal, reset resets the operating system if things go wrong, ok has
					two functions: ok on turns the OK LED on, and ok off turns the OK LED off, and cls
					clears the terminal using TerminalClear.</p>
				<p>
					Have a go with this code on the Raspberry Pi. If it doesn't work, please see our
					troubleshooting page.</p>
				<p>
					When it works, congratulations you've completed a basic terminal Operating System,
					and have completed the input series. Unfortunately, this is as far as these tutorials
					go at the moment, but I hope to make more in the future. Please send feedback to
					<a href="mailto:awc32@cam.ac.uk">awc32@cam.ac.uk</a>.</p>
				<p>
					You're now in position to start building some simple terminal Operating Systems.
					My code above builds up a table of available commands in commandTable. Each entry
					in the table is an int for the address of the string, and an int for the address
					of the code to run. The last entry has to be commandStringEnd, 0. Try implementing
					some of your own commands, using our existing functions, or making new ones. The
					parameters for the functions to run are r0 is the address of the command the user
					typed, and r1 is the length. You can use this to pass inputs to your commands. Maybe
					you could make a calculator program, perhaps a drawing program or a chess program.
					Whatever ideas you've got, give them a go!</p>
