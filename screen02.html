				<p>
					The Screen02 lesson builds on Screen01, by teaching how to draw lines and also
					a small feature on generating pseudo random numbers. It is assumed you have the
					code for the <a href="screen01.html">Lesson 6: Screen01</a> operating system as a
					basis.</p>

					Now that we've got the screen working, it is only natural to start waiting to create
					sensible images. It would be very nice indeed if we were able to actually draw something.
					One of the most basic components in all drawings is a line. If we were able to draw
					a line between any two points on the screen, we could start creating more complicated
					drawings just using combinations of these lines.
				</p>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>To allow complex drawing, some systems use a colouring
				function rather than just one colour to draw things. Each pixel calls the colouring function
				to determine what colour to draw there.</p></div>
				<p>
					We will attempt to implement this in assembly code, but first we could really use
					some other functions to help. We need a function I will call SetPixel that changes
					the colour of a particular pixel, supplied as inputs in r0 and r1. It will be helpful
					for future if we write code that could draw to any memory, not just the screen,
					so first of all, we need some system to control where we are actually going to draw
					to. I think that the best way to do this would be to have a piece of memory which
					stores where we are going to draw to. What we should end up with is a stored
					address which normally points to the frame buffer structure from last time. We will
					use this at all times in our drawing method. That way, if we want to draw to a different
					image in another part of our operating system, we could make this value the address
					of a different structure, and use the exact same code. For simplicity we will use
					another piece of data to control the colour of our drawings.</p>
				<p>
					Copy the following code to a new file called 'drawing.s'.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					.section .data<br />
					.align 1<br />
					foreColour:<br />
					.hword 0xFFFF<br />
					<br />
					.align 2<br />
					graphicsAddress:<br />
					.int 0<br />
					<br />
					.section .text<br />
					.globl SetForeColour<br />
					SetForeColour:<br />
					cmp r0,#0x10000<br />
					movhs pc,lr<br />
					ldr r1,=foreColour<br />
					strh r0,[r1]<br />
					mov pc,lr<br />
					<br />
					.globl SetGraphicsAddress<br />
					SetGraphicsAddress:<br />
					ldr r1,=graphicsAddress<br />
					str r0,[r1]<br />
					mov pc,lr<br />
				</div>
				<p>
					This is just the pair of functions that I described above, along with their data.
					We will use them in 'main.s' before drawing anything to control where and what we
					are drawing.
				</p>
				<div class="informationBox">
				<p>Building generic methods like SetPixel which we can build other methods on top of is
				a useful idea. We have to make sure the method is fast though, since we will use it a lot.</p></div>
				<p>
					Our next task is to implement a SetPixel method. This needs to take two parameters,
					the x and y co-ordinate of a pixel, and it should use the graphicsAddress and foreColour
					we have just defined to control exactly what and where it is drawing. If you think
					you can implement this immediately, do, if not I shall outline the steps to be taken,
					and then give an example implementation.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Load in the graphicsAddress.</li>
					<li>Check that the x and y co-ordinates of the pixel are less than the width and height.</li>
					<li>Compute the address of the pixel to write. (hint: frameBufferAddress + (x + y * width)
						* pixel size)</li>
					<li>Load in the foreColour.</li>
					<li>Store it at the address.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					An implementation of the above follows.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
							.globl DrawPixel<br />
							DrawPixel:<br />
							px .req r0<br />
							py .req r1<br />
							addr .req r2<br />

							ldr addr,[addr]<br />
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
							height .req r3<br />
							ldr height,[addr,#4]<br />
							sub height,#1<br />
							cmp py,height<br />
							movhi pc,lr<br />
							.unreq height<br />
							<br />
							width .req r3<br />
							ldr width,[addr,#0]<br />
							sub width,#1<br />
							cmp px,width<br />
							movhi pc,lr<br />
						</div>
						<p>
							Remember that the width and height are stored at offsets of 0 and 4 into the frame
							buffer description respectively. You can refer back to 'frameBuffer.s' if necessary.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
							ldr addr,[addr,#32]<br />

							mla px,py,width,px<br />
							.unreq width<br />
							.unreq py<br />
							add addr, px,lsl #1<br />
							.unreq px<br />
						</div>
						<p>
							Admittedly, this code is specific to high colour frame buffers, as I use a bit shift
							directly to compute this address. You may wish to code a version of this function
							without the specific requirement to use high colour frame buffers, remembering to
							update the SetForeColour code. It may be significantly more complicated to implement.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
							fore .req r3<br />
							ldr fore,=foreColour<br />
							ldrh fore,[fore]<br />
						</div>
						<p>

					</li>

						<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
							strh fore,[addr]<br />
							.unreq fore<br />

				<p>
					The trouble is, line drawing isn't quite as simple as you may expect. By now you
					must realise that when making operating system, we have to do almost everything
					ourselves, and line drawing is no exception. I suggest for a few minutes you have
					a think about how you would draw a line between any two points.</p>
				<div class="informationBox">
					<p>
						When programming normally, we tend to be lazy with things like division. Operating
						Systems must be incredibly efficient, and so we must focus on doing things as best
						as possible.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					I expect the central idea of most strategies will involve computing the gradient
					of the line, and stepping along it. This sounds perfectly reasonable, but is actually
					a terrible idea. The problem with it is it involves division, which is something
					that we know can't easily be done in assembly, and also keeping track of decimal
					numbers, which is again difficult. There is, in fact, an algorithm called Bresenham's
					Algorithm, which is perfect for assembly code because it only involves addition,
					subtraction and bit shifts.

						This algorithm is a representation of the sort of thing you may have imagined. The
						variable error keeps track of how far away from the actual line we are. Every step
						we take along the x axis increases this error, and every time we move down the y
						axis, the error decreases by 1 unit again. The error is measured as a distance along
						the y axis.
					</p>
					<p>
						While this algorithm works, it suffers a major problem in that we clearly have to
						use decimal numbers to store error, and also we have to do a division. An immediate
						optimisation would therefore be to change the units of error. There is no need to
						store it in any particular units, as long as we scale every use of it by the same
						amount. Therefore, we could rewrite the algorithm simply by multiplying all equations
						involving error by deltay, and simplifying the result. Just showing the main loop:</p>
					<div class="pseudoCodeBlock"><p>
						<span class="keyword">set </span>error <span class="keyword">to </span>0 &times;
						deltay<br />
						<span class="keyword">until </span>x0 = x1 + stepx<br />
						<div class="indent"><p>
							<span class="keyword">setPixel</span>(x0, y0)<br />
							<span class="keyword">set </span>error <span class="keyword">to </span>error + deltax
							&divide; deltay &times; deltay<br />
							<span class="keyword">if </span>error &ge; 0.5 &times; deltay <span class="keyword">
								then </span>
							<br />
							<div class="indent"><p>
								<span class="keyword">set </span>y0 <span class="keyword">to </span>y0 + stepy<br />
								<span class="keyword">set </span>error <span class="keyword">to </span>error - 1

							<span class="keyword">set </span>x0 <span class="keyword">to </span>x0 + stepx<br />
						</div><p>
						<span class="keyword">repeat</span><br />
					</div>
					<p>
						Which simplifies to:</p>
					<div class="pseudoCodeBlock"><p>
						<span class="keyword">set </span>error <span class="keyword">to </span>0<br />
						<span class="keyword">until </span>x0 = x1 + stepx<br />

						</div><p>
						<span class="keyword">repeat</span><br />
					</div>
					<p>
						Suddenly we have a much better algorithm. We see now that we've eliminated the need
						for division altogether. Better still, the only multiplication is by 2, which we
						know is just a bit shift left by 1! This is now very close to Bresenham's Algorithm,
						but one further optimisation can be made. At the moment, we have an if statement
						which leads to two very similar blocks of code, one for lines with larger x differences,
						and one for lines with larger y differences. It is worth checking if the code could
						be converted to a single statement for both types of line.</p>
					<p>
						The difficulty arises somewhat in that in the first case, error is to do with y,
						and in the second case error is to do with x. The solution is to track the error
						in both variables simultaneously, using negative error to represent an error in
						x, and positive error in y.

						It may take some time to convince yourself that this actually works. At each step,
						we consider if it would be correct to move in x or y. We do this by checking if
						the magnitude of the error would be lower if we moved in the x or y co-ordinates,
						and then moving if so.</p>

					3 Randomness</h2>
				<p>
					So, now we can draw lines. Although we could use this to draw pictures and whatnot
					(feel free to do so!), I thought I would take the opportunity to introduce the idea
					of computer randomness. What we will do is select a pair of random co-ordinates,
					and then draw a line from the last pair to that point in steadily incrementing colours.
					I do this purely because it looks quite pretty.</p>
				<div class="informationBox">
					<p>
						Hardware random number generators are occasionally used in security, where the predictability
						sequence of random numbers may affect the security of some encryption.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					So, now it comes down to it, how do we be random? Unfortunately for us there isn't
					some device which generates random numbers (such devices are very rare). So somehow
					using only the operations we've learned so far we need to invent 'random numbers'.
					It shouldn't take you long to realise this is impossible. The operations always
					have well defined results, executing the same sequence of instructions with the
					same registers yields the same answer. What we instead do is deduce a sequence that
					is pseudo random. This means numbers that, to the outside observer, look random,
					but in fact were completely determined. So, we need a formula to generate random
					numbers. One might be tempted to just spam mathematical operators out for example:
					4x<sup>2</sup>! / 64, but in actuality this generally produces low quality random
					numbers. In this case for example, if x were 0, the answer would be 0. Stupid though
					it sounds, we need a very careful choice of equation to produce high quality random
					numbers.
				</p>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>This sort of discussion often begs the question what do we
				mean by a random number? We generally mean statistical randomness: A sequence of numbers
				that has no obvious patterns or properties that could be used to generalise it.</p></div>
				<p>
					The method I'm going to teach you is called the quadratic congruence generator.
					This is a good choice because it can be implemented in 5 instructions, and yet generates
					a seemingly random order of the numbers from 0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1.
				</p>
				<p>
					The reason why the generator can create such long sequence with so few instructions
					is unfortunately a little beyond the scope of this course, but I encourage the interested
					to research it. It all centralises on the following quadratic formula, where <span
						class="equationInline">x<sub>n</sub></span> is the nth random number generated.</p>
				<div class="equation"><p>
					x<sub>n+1</sub> = ax<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + bx<sub>n</sub> + c mod 2<sup>32</sup></div>
				<p>
					Subject to the following constraints:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><span class="equationInline">a</span> is even</li>
					<li><span class="equationInline">b = a + 1 mod 4</span></li>
					<li><span class="equationInline">c</span> is odd</li></ol>
				<p>
					If you've not seen mod before, it means the remainder of a division by the number
					after it. For example <span class="equationInline">b = a + 1 mod 4</span> means
					that b is the remainder of dividing <span class="equationInline">a + 1</span> by
					4, so if <span class="equationInline">a</span> were 12 say, <span class="equationInline">
						b</span> would be 1 as <span class="equationInline">a + 1</span> is 13, and
					13 divided by 4 is 3 remainder 1.</p>

					generated in <span class="armCodeInline">r0</span>, and an output of the next number.
					In my case, I've used a = EF00<sub>16</sub>, b = 1, c = 73. This choice was arbitrary
					but meets the requirements above. Feel free to use any numbers you wish instead,
					as long as they obey the rules.</p>

					OK, now we have all the functions we're going to need, let's try it out. Alter main
					to do the following, after getting the frame buffer info address:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Call SetGraphicsAddress with r0 containing the frame buffer info address.</li>
					<li>Set four registers to 0. One will be the last random number, one will be the colour,
						one will be the last x co-ordinate and one will be the last y co-ordinate.</li>
					<li>Call random to generate the next x-coordinate, using the last random number as the
						input.</li>
					<li>Call random again to generate the next y-coordinate, using the x-coordinate you
						generated as an input.</li>
					<li>Update the last random number to contain the y-coordinate.</li>
					<li>Call SetForeColour with the colour, then increment the colour. If it goes above
						FFFF<sub>16</sub>, make sure it goes back to 0.</li>
					<li>The x and y coordinates we have generated are between 0 and FFFFFFFF<sub>16</sub>.
						Convert them to a number between 0 and 1023<sub>10</sub> by using a logical shift
						right of 22.</li>
					<li>Check the y coordinate is on the screen. Valid y coordinates are between 0 and 767<sub>10</sub>.
						If not, go back to 3.</li>
					<li>Draw a line from the last x and y coordinates to the current x and y coordinates.</li>
					<li>Update the last x and y coordinates to contain the current ones.</li>
					<li>Go back to 3.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					As always, a solution for this can be found on the downloads page.</p>
				<p>
					Once you've finished, test it on the Raspberry Pi. You should see a very fast sequence
					of random lines being drawn on the screen, in steadily incrementing colours. This
					should never stop. If it doesn't work, please see our troubleshooting page.

					When you have it working, congratulations! We've now learned about meaningful graphics,
					and also about random numbers. I encourage you to play with line drawing, as it
					can be used to render almost anything you want. You may also want to explore more
					complicated shapes. Most can be made out of lines, but is this necessarily the best
					strategy? If you like the line program, try experimenting with the SetPixel function.
					What happens if instead of just setting the value of the pixel, you increase it
					by a small amount? What other patterns can you make? In the next lesson, <a href="screen03.html">
						Lesson 8: Screen 03</a>, we will look at the invaluable skill of drawing text.</p>
