				<p>
					The OK05 lesson builds on OK04 using it to flash the SOS Morse Code pattern (...---...).
					It is assumed you have the code for the <a href="ok03.html">Lesson 4: OK04</a> operating
					system as a basis.
				</p>

					1 Data</h2>
				<p>
					So far, all we've had to do with our operating system is provide instructions to
					be followed. Sometimes however, instructions are only half the story. Our operating
					systems may need data.</p>
				<div class="informationBox">
					<p>
						Some early Operating Systems did only allow certain types of data in certain files,
						but this was generally found to be too restrictive. The modern way does make programs
						a lot more complicated however.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					In general data is just values that are important. You are probably trained to think
					of data as being of a specific type, e.g. a text file contains text, an image file
					contains an image, etc. This is, in truth, just an idea. All data on a computer
					is just binary numbers, how we choose to interpret them is what counts. In this
					example we're going to store a light flashing sequence as data.</p>
				<p>
					At the end of 'main.s' copy the following code:</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock">
					<p>
						.section .data<br />
						.align 2<br />
						pattern:<br />
						.int 0b11111111101010100010001000101010<br />
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox">
					<p>
						<span class="armCodeInline">.align num</span> ensures the address of the next line
						is a multiple of 2<span class="armCodeInline"><sup>num</sup></span>
					.</div>
				<div class="commandBox">
					<p>
						<span class="armCodeInline">.int val</span> outputs the number <span class="armCodeInline">
							val</span>
					.</div>
				<p>
					To differentiate between data and code, we put all the data in the .data. I've included
					this on the operating system memory layout diagram here. I've just chosen to put
					the data after the end of the code. The reason for keeping our data and instructions
					separate is so that if we eventually implement some security on our operating system,
					we need to know what parts of the code can be executed, and what parts can't.</p>
				<p>
					I've used two new commands here. <span class="armCodeInline">.align</span> and <span
						class="armCodeInline">.int</span>. <span class="armCodeInline">.align</span>
					ensures alignment of the following data to a specified power of 2. In this case
					I've used <span class="armCodeInline">.align 2</span> which means that this data
					will definitely be placed at an address which is a multiple of 2<sup>2</sup> = 4.
					It is really important to do this, because the <span class="armCodeInline">ldr</span>
					instruction we used to read memory only works at addresses that are multiples of
					4.</p>
				<p>
					The <span class="armCodeInline">.int</span> command copies the constant after it
					into the output directly. That means that 11111111101010100010001000101010<sub>2</sub>
					will be placed into the output, and so the label pattern actually labels this piece
					of data as pattern.</p>
				<div class="informationBox">
					<p>
						One challenge with data is finding an efficient and useful representation. This
						method of storing the sequence as on and off units of time is easy to run, but would
						be difficult to edit, as the concept of a Morse - or . is lost.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					As I mentioned, data can mean whatever you want. In this case I've encoded the Morse
					Code SOS sequence, which is ...---... for those unfamiliar. I've used a 0 to represent
					a unit of time with the LED off, and a 1 to represent a unit of time with the LED
					on. That way, we can write some code which just displays a sequence in data like
					this one, and then all we have to do to make it display a different sequence is
					change the data. This is a very simple example of what operating systems must do
					all the time; interpret and display data.</p>
				<p>
					Copy the following lines before the <span class="armCodeInline">loop$</span> label
					in 'main.s'.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock">
					<p>
						ptrn .req r4<br />
						ldr ptrn,=pattern<br />
						ldr ptrn,[ptrn]<br />
						seq .req r5<br />
						mov seq,#0<br />
				</div>
				<p>
					This code loads the pattern into <span class="armCodeInline">r4</span>, and loads
					0 into <span class="armCodeInline">r5</span>. <span class="armCodeInline">r5</span>
					will be our sequence position, so we can keep track of how much of the pattern we
					have displayed.</p>
				<p>
					The following code puts a non-zero into <span class="armCodeInline">r1</span> if
					and only if there is a 1 in the current part of the pattern.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock">
					<p>
						mov r1,#1<br />
						lsl r1,seq<br />
						and r1,ptrn<br />
				</div>
				<p>
					This code is useful for your calls to SetGpio, which must have a non-zero value
					to turn the LED off, and a value of zero to turn the LED on.</p>
				<p>
					Now modify all of your code in 'main.s' so that each loop the code sets the LED
					based on the current sequence number, waits for 250000 micro seconds (or any other
					appropriate delay), and then increments the sequence number. When the sequence number
					reaches 32, it needs to go back to 0. See if you can implement this, and for an
					extra challenge, try to do it using only 1 instruction (solution in the download).</p>
				<h2 id="tfwyhf">
					2 Time Flies When You're Having Fun...</h2>
				<p>
					You're now ready to test this on the Raspberry Pi. It should flash out a sequence
					of 3 short pulses, 3 long pulses and then 3 more short pulses. After a delay, the
					pattern should repeat. If it doesn't work please see our troubleshooting page.</p>
				<p>
					Once it works, congratulations you have reached the end of the OK series of tutorials.</p>
				<p>
					In this series we've learnt about assembly code, the GPIO controller and the System
					Timer. We've learnt about functions and the ABI, as well as several basic Operating
					System concepts, and also about data.</p>
				<p>
					You're now ready to move onto one of the more advanced series.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The <a href="screen01.html">Screen</a> series is next and teaches you how to use
						the screen with assembly code.</li>
					<li>The <a href="input01.html">Input</a> series teaches you how to use the keyboard
						and mouse.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					By now you already have enough information to make Operating Systems that interact
					with the GPIO in other ways. If you have any robot kits, you may want to try writing
					a robot operating system controlled with the GPIO pins!</p>
