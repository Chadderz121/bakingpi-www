					This introductory lesson does not contain a practical element, but exists to explain
					the basic concepts of what is an operating system, what is assembly code and other
					important basics. If you just want to get straight into practicals, it should be
					safe to skip this lesson.

					1 Operating Systems</h2>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>
					Throughout these tutorials I will put interesting information in boxes like this
					one.</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					Throughout these tutorials I will put information about each command we learn in
					boxes like this one.</div>
				<p>
					An operating system is just a very complicated program. It has the job of organising
					other programs on a computer, including sharing the computer's time, memory, hardware
					and other resources. Some big families of desktop operating systems that you may
					have heard of include GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. Other devices also
					need operating systems such as phones, which may use operating systems such as Android,
					iOS and Windows Phone.<a class="noteLink" name="note1a" href="#note1" title="Note 1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
				<p>
					Since the operating system has to interact with the hardware on a computer system,
					it also has to have specific knowledge of the hardware on a system. To allow operating
					systems to be used on a variety of computers, the concept of <strong>drivers</strong>
					was invented. Drivers are small bits of code that can be added and removed from
					the operating system in order to allow the operating system to talk to a particular
					piece of hardware. In this course, we do not cover how to create such removable
					drivers, and instead focus on making specific ones for the Raspberry Pi.</p>
				<p>
					There are all kinds of different designs of operating systems, and this course can
					only just scratch the surface. In this course we will mainly focus on getting the
					operating system to interact with a variety of bits of hardware, as this is often
					the trickiest bit, and the part for which the least documentation and help exists
					online.</p>
				<h2 id="ac">
					2 Assembly Code</h2>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>
					A processor can often perform millions of instructions per second, but they must
					be simple.</div>
				<p>
					This course will be written almost exclusively in assembly code. Assembly code is
					code that is <em>very</em> close to what the computer understands. How a computer
					really works is that there is a small device called a processor which is capable
					of performing simple jobs like adding numbers, and there is a set of one or more
					microchips called the <strong title="Random Access Memory">RAM</strong> which are
					capable of storing numbers. When a computer has power, the processor works through
					a sequence of instructions given to it by the programmer, which cause it to change
					numbers in the RAM, and interact with connected hardware. Assembly code is a translation
					into human readable text of those commands.</p>
				<p>
					When programming normally, the programmer writes code in a programming language
					such as C++, Java, C#, Basic, etc, and then a program called the compiler translates
					what the programmer wrote into assembly code, which is the further reduced into
					binary code<a class="noteLink" name="note2a" href="#note2" title="Note 2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.
					Binary code is what the computer actually understands, but it is almost impossible
					for humans to read. Assembly code is much better, but it can be frustrating how
					few commands are possible. Remember that every command you write in assembly code
					is something that the processor understands directly, and so the commands are simple
					by design, as a physical circuit must process each one.</p>
				<img alt="Compiler process" src="images/compiling.png" />
				<p>
					Just like with ordinary programming, there are many different assembly code languages,
					however unlike ordinary programming, the reason these exist is due to the fact that
					there exists many different processors, each designed to understand a different
					language. Thus a program written in assembly code for one machine, will not work
					on a different one. For most things, this would be a disaster as each program would
					have to be rewritten for every system it was used on, but for operating systems
					this isn't so much of a problem, as it would have to be rewritten anyway due to
					differing hardware. Nevertheless, most operating systems are written in C++ or C,
					so that they can be converted more easily, and only the sections that absolutely
					have to be written in assembly are.
