					The OK03 lesson builds on OK02 by teaching how to use functions in assembly to make
					more reusable and rereadable code. It is assumed you have the code for the <a href="ok02.html">
						Lesson 2: OK02</a> operating system as a basis.

					1 Reusable Code</h2>
				<p>
					So far we've made code for our operating system by typing the things we want to
					happen in order. This is fine for such tiny programs, but if we wrote the whole
					system like this, the code would be completely unreadable. Instead we use functions.</p>
				<div class="expandableHeader" onclick="return ExpandToggle('functions')">

				</div>
				<div id="functions" class="expandable">
					<p>
						A function is a piece of code that can be reused to compute a certain kind of answer,
						or perform a certain action. You may also hear them called procedures, routines
						or subroutines. Although these are all different, people rarely use the correct
						term.</p>
					<p>
						You should already be happy with the concept of a function from mathematics. For
						example the cosine function applied to a number gives another number between -1
						and 1 which is the cosine of the angle. Notationally we write cos(x) to be the cosine
						function applied to the value x.
					</p>
					<p>
						In code, functions can take multiple inputs (including none), give multiple outputs
						(including none), and may cause side effects. For example a function might create
						a file on the file system, named after the first input, with length based on the
						second.</p>
				</div>
				<img alt="Function as black boxes" src="images/functions.png" class="marginDiagram" />
				<div class="informationBox"><p>Functions are
					said to be 'black boxes'. We put inputs in, and outputs come out, but we don't need
					to know how they work.</div>
				<p>
					In higher level code such as C or C++, functions are part of the language itself.
					In assembly code, functions are just ideas we have.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ideally we want to be able to set our registers to some input values, branch to
					an address, and expect that at some point the code will branch back to our code
					having set the registers to output values. This is what a function is in assembly
					code. The difficulty comes in what system we use for setting the registers. If we
					just used any system we felt like, each programmer may use a different system, and
					would find other programmers' work hard to understand. Further, compilers would
					not be able to work with assembly code as easily, as they would not know how to
					use the functions. To prevent confusion, a standard called the Application Binary
					Interface (ABI) was devised for each assembly language which is an agreement on
					how functions should be run. If everyone makes functions in the same way, then everyone
					will be able to use each others' functions. I will teach that standard here, and from
					now on I will code all of my functions to meet the standard.</p>
				<p>
					The standard says that r0,r1,r2 and r3 will be used as inputs to a function in order.
					If a function needs no inputs, then it doesn't matter what value it takes. If it
					needs only one it always goes in r0, if it needs two, the first goes in r0, and
					the second goes on r1, and so on. The output will always be in r0. If a function
					has no output, it doesn't matter what value r0 takes.</p>
				<p>
					Further, it also requires that after a function is run, r4 to r12 must have the
					same values as they had when the function started. This means that when you call
					a function, you can be sure the r4 to r12 will not change value, but you cannot
					be so sure about r0 to r3.</p>
				<p>
					When a function completes it has to branch back to the code that started it. This
					means it must know the address of the code that started it. To facilitate this,
					there is a special register called lr (link register) which always holds the address
					of the instruction after the one that called this function.</p>

				<p>
					Often functions need to use more registers than just r0 to r3. But, since r4 to
					r12 must stay the same after the method has run, they must be saved somewhere. We
					save them on something called the stack.</p>
				<div class="expandableHeader" onclick="return ExpandToggle('stack')"><p><a class="icon-more">Stack explained</a></p></div>
				<div id="stack" class="expandable">
					<img class="sideDiagram" alt="Stack diagram" src="images/stack.png" />
					<p>
						A stack is a metaphor we use in computing for a method of storing values. Just like
						in a stack of plates, you can only remove items from the top of a stack, and only
						add items to the top of the stack.</p>
					<p>
						The stack is a brilliant idea for storing registers on when functions are running.
						For example if I have a function which needs to use registers r4 and r5, it could
						place the current values of those registers on a stack. At the end of the method
						it could take them back off again. What is most clever is that if my function had
						to run another function in order to complete and that function needed to save some
						registers, it could put those on the top of the stack while it ran, and then take
						them off again at the end. That wouldn't affect the values of r4 and r5 that my
						method had to save, as they would be added to the top of the stack, and then taken
						off again.</p>
					<p>
						The terminology we used to refer to the values put on the stack by a particular
						method is that methods 'stack frame'. Not every method needs a stack frame, some
						don't need to store values.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					Because the stack is so useful, it has been implemented in the ARMv6 instruction
					set directly. A special register called sp (stack pointer) holds the address of
					the stack. When items are added to the stack, the sp register updates so that it
					always holds the address of the first item on the stack. <span class="armCodeInline">
						push {r4,r5}</span> would put the values in r4 and r5 onto the top of the stack
					and <span class="armCodeInline">pop {r4,r5}</span> would take them back off again
					(in the correct order).</p>
				<h2 id="firstfunction">
					2 Our First Function</h2>
				<p>
					Now that we have some idea about how functions work, let's try to make one. For
					a basic first example, we are going to make a function that takes no input, and
					gives an output of the GPIO address. In the last lesson, we just wrote in this value,
					but it would be better as a function, since it is something we might need to do
					often in a real operating system, and we might not always remember the address.</p>
				<p>
					Copy the following code into a new file called 'gpio.s'. Just make the new file
					in the 'source' directory with 'main.s'. We're going to put all functions related
					to the GPIO controller in one file to make them easier to find.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					.globl GetGpioAddress<br />
					GetGpioAddress:<br />
					ldr r0,=0x20200000<br />
					mov pc,lr<br />
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">.globl lbl</span> makes the label <span class="armCodeInline">
						lbl </span>accessible from other files.</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">mov reg1,reg2</span> copies the value in <span class="armCodeInline">
						reg2</span> into <span class="armCodeInline">reg1</span>.</div>
				<p>
					This is a very simple complete function. The <span class="armCodeInline">.globl GetGpioAddress</span>
					command is a message to the assembler to make the label <span class="armCodeInline">
						GetGpioAddress</span> accessible to all files. This means that in our main.s
					file we can branch to the label <span class="armCodeInline">GetGpioAddress</span>
					even though it is not defined in that file.</p>
				<p>
					You should recognise the <span class="armCodeInline">ldr r0,=0x20200000</span> command,
					which stores the GPIO controller address in r0. Since this is a function, we have
					to give the output in r0, so we are not as free to use any register as we once were.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">mov pc,lr</span> copies the value in <span class="armCodeInline">
						lr</span> to <span class="armCodeInline">pc</span>. As mentioned earlier <span class="armCodeInline">
							lr</span> always contains the address of the code that we have to go back
					to when a method finishes. <span class="armCodeInline">pc</span> is a special register
					which always contains the address of the next instruction to be run. A normal branch
					command just changes the value of this register. By copying the value in <span class="armCodeInline">
						lr</span> to <span class="armCodeInline">pc</span> we just change the next line
					to be run to be the one we were told to go back to.</p>
				<p>
					A reasonable question would now be, how would we actually run this code? A special
					type of branch <span class="armCodeInline">bl</span> does what we need. It branches
					to a label like a normal branch, but before it does it updates <span class="armCodeInline">
						lr</span> to contain the address of the line after the branch. That means that
					when the function finishes, the line it will go back to will be the one after the
					<span class="armCodeInline">bl</span> command. This makes a function running just
					look like any other command, it simply runs, does whatever it needs to do, and then
					carries on to the next line. This is a really useful way of thinking about functions.
					We treat them as 'black boxes' in that when we use them, we don't need to think
					about how they work, we just need to know what inputs they need, and what outputs
					they give.</p>
				<p>
					For now, don't worry about using the function, we will use it in the next section.</p>
				<h2 id="bigfunction">
					3 A Big Function</h2>
				<p>
					Now we're going to implement a bigger function. Our first job was to enable output
					on GPIO pin 16. It would be nice if this was a function. We could simply specify
					a pin and a function as the input, and the function would set the function of that
					pin to that value. That way, we could use the code to control any GPIO pin, not
					just the LED.</p>
				<p>
					Copy the following commands below the GetGpioAddress function in gpio.s.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					.globl SetGpioFunction<br />
					SetGpioFunction:<br />
					cmp r0,#53<br />
					cmpls r1,#7<br />
					movhi pc,lr<br />
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					Suffix <span class="armCodeInline">ls</span> causes the command to be executed only
					if the last comparison determined that the first number was less than or the same
					as the second. Unsigned.</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					Suffix <span class="armCodeInline">hi</span> causes the command to be executed only
					if the last comparison determined that the first number was higher than the second.
					Unsigned.</div>
				<p>
					One of the first things we should always think about when writing functions is our
					inputs. What do we do if they are wrong? In this function, we have one input which
					is a GPIO pin number, and so must be a number between 0 and 53, since there are
					54 pins. Each pin has 8 functions, numbered 0 to 7 and so the function code must
					be too. We could just assume that the inputs will be correct, but this is very dangerous
					when working with hardware, as incorrect values could cause very bad side effects.
					Therefore, in this case, we wish to make sure the inputs are in the right ranges.</p>
				<p>
					To do this we need to check that r0 &lt;= 53 and r1 &lt;= 7. First of all, we can
					use the comparison we've seen before to compare the value of r0 with 53. The next
					instruction, <span class="armCodeInline">cmpls</span> is a normal comparison instruction
					that will only be run if r0 was lower than or the same as 53. If that was the case,
					it compares r1 with 7, otherwise the result of the comparison is the same as before.
					Finally we go back to the code that ran the function if the result of the last comparison
					was that the register was higher than the number.
				</p>
				<p>
					The effect of this is exactly what we want. If r0 was bigger than 53, then the <span
						class="armCodeInline">cmpls</span> command doesn't run, but the <span class="armCodeInline">
							movhi</span> does. If r0 is &lt;= 53, then the <span class="armCodeInline">cmpls</span>
					command does run, and so <span class="armCodeInline">r1</span> is compared with
					7, and then if it is higher than 7, <span class="armCodeInline">movhi</span> is
					run, and the function ends, otherwise <span class="armCodeInline">movhi</span> does
					not run, and we know for sure that r0 &lt;= 53 and r1 &lt;= 7.</p>
				<p>
					There is a subtle difference between the <span class="armCodeInline">ls</span> (lower
					or same) and <span class="armCodeInline">le</span> (less or equal) as well as between
					<span class="armCodeInline">hi</span> (higher) and <span class="armCodeInline">gt</span>
					(greater) suffixes, but I will cover this later.</p>
				<p>
					Copy these commands below the above.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					push {lr}<br />
					mov r2,r0<br />
					bl GetGpioAddress<br />
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">push {reg1,reg2,...}</span> copies the registers in
					the list <span class="armCodeInline">reg1,reg2,...</span> onto the top of the stack.
					Only general purpose registers and lr can be pushed.</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">bl lbl</span> sets <span class="armCodeInline">lr</span>
					to the address of the next instruction and then branches to the label <span class="armCodeInline">
						lbl</span>.</div>
				<p>
					These next three commands are focused on calling our first method. The <span class="armCodeInline">
						push {lr}</span> command copies the value in <span class="armCodeInline">lr</span>
					onto the top of the stack, so that we can retrieve it later. We must do this because
					when we call GetGpioAddress, we will need to use <span class="armCodeInline">lr</span>
					to store the address to come back to in our function.</p>
				<p>
					If we did not know anything about the GetGpioAddress function, we would have to
					assume it changes r0,r1,r2 and r3, and would have to move our values to r4 and r5
					to keep them the same after it finishes. Fortunately, we do know about GetGpioAddress,
					and we know it only changes r0 to the address, it doesn't affect r1,r2 or r3. Thus,
					we only have to move the GPIO pin number out of r0 so it doesn't get overwritten,
					but we know we can safely move it to r2, as GetGpioAddress doesn't change r2.</p>
				<p>
					Finally we use the <span class="armCodeInline">bl</span> instruction to run GetGpioAddress.
					Normally we use the term 'call' for running a function, and I will from now. As
					discussed earlier <span class="armCodeInline">bl</span> calls a function by updating
					the lr to the next instruction's address, and then branching to the function.</p>
				<p>
					When a function ends we say it has 'returned'. When the call to GetGpioAddress returns,
					we now know that r0 contains the GPIO address, r1 contains the function code and
					r2 contains the GPIO pin number. I mentioned earlier that the GPIO functions are
					stored in blocks of 10, so first we need to determine which block of ten our pin
					number is in. This sounds like a job we would use a division for, but divisions
					are very slow indeed, so it is better for such small numbers to do repeated subtraction.</p>
				<p>
					Copy the following code below the above.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					functionLoop$:<br />
					<div class="indent"><p>
						cmp r2,#9<br />
						subhi r2,#10<br />
						addhi r0,#4<br />
						bhi functionLoop$<br />
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">add reg,#val</span> adds the number <span class="armCodeInline">
						val</span> to the contents of the register <span class="armCodeInline">reg</span>.</div>
				<p>
					This simple loop code compares the pin number to 9. If it is higher than 9, it subtracts
					10 from the pin number, and adds 4 to the GPIO Controller address then runs the
					check again.</p>
				<p>
					The effect of this is that r2 will now contain a number from 0 to 9 which represents
					the remainder of dividing the pin number by 10. r0 will now contain the address
					in the GPIO controller of this pin's function settings. This would be the same as
					GPIO Controller Address + 4 &times; (GPIO Pin Number &divide; 10).</p>
				<p>
					Finally, copy the following code below the above.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					add r2, r2,lsl #1<br />
					lsl r1,r2<br />
					str r1,[r0]<br />
					pop {pc}<br />
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					Argument shift <span class="armCodeInline">reg,lsl #val</span> shifts the binary
					representation of the number in <span class="armCodeInline">reg</span> left by <span
						class="armCodeInline">val</span> before using it in the operation before.</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">lsl reg,amt</span> shifts the binary representation
					of the number in <span class="armCodeInline">reg</span> left by the number in <span
						class="armCodeInline">amt</span>.</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">str reg,[dst]</span> is the same as <span class="armCodeInline">
						str reg,[dst,#0]</span>.</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">pop {reg1,reg2,...}</span> copies the values from the
					top of the stack into the register list <span class="armCodeInline">reg1,reg2,...</span>.
					Only general purpose registers and pc can be popped.</div>
				<p>
					This code finishes off the method. The first line is actually a multiplication by
					3 in disguise. Multiplication is a big and slow instruction in assembly code, as
					the circuit can take a long time to come up with the answer. It is much faster sometimes
					to use some instructions which can get the answer quicker. In this case, I know
					that r2 &times; 3 is the same as r2 &times; 2 + r2. It is very easy to multiply a
					register by 2 as this is conveniently the same as shifting the binary representation
					of the number left by one place.</p>
				<p>
					One of the very useful features of the ARMv6 assembly code language is the ability
					to shift an argument before using it. In this case, I add <span class="armCodeInline">
						r2</span> to the result of shifting the binary representation of <span class="armCodeInline">
							r2</span> to the left by one place. In assembly code, you often use tricks
					such as this to compute answers more easily, but if you're uncomfortable with this,
					you could also write something like <span class="armCodeInline">mov r3,r2</span>;
					<span class="armCodeInline">add r2,r3</span>; <span class="armCodeInline">add r2,r3</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now we shift the function value left by a number of places equal to r2. Most instructions
					such as <span class="armCodeInline">add</span> and <span class="armCodeInline">sub</span>
					have a variant which uses a register rather than a number for the amount. We perform
					this shift because we want to set the bits that correspond to our pin number, and
					there are three bits per pin.
				</p>
				<p>
					We then store the the computed function value at the address in the GPIO controller.
					We already worked out the address in the loop, so we don't need to store it at an
					offset like we did in OK01 and OK02.</p>
				<p>
					Finally, we can return from this method call. Since we pushed <span class="armCodeInline">
						lr</span> onto the stack, if we pop <span class="armCodeInline">pc</span>, it
					will copy the value that was in <span class="armCodeInline">lr</span> at the time
					we pushed it into <span class="armCodeInline">pc</span>. This would be the same
					as having used <span class="armCodeInline">mov pc,lr</span> and so the function
					call will return when this line is run.</p>
				<p>
					The very keen may notice that this function doesn't actually work correctly. Although
					it sets the function of the GPIO pin to the requested value, it causes all the pins
					in the same block of 10's functions to go back to 0! This would likely be quite
					annoying in a system which made heavy use of the GPIO pins. I leave it as a challenge
					to the interested to fix this function so that it does not overwrite other pins
					values by ensuring that all bits other than the 3 that must be set remain the same.
					A solution to this can be found on the downloads page for this lesson. Functions
					that you may find useful are <span class="armCodeInline">and</span> which computes
					the Boolean and function of two registers, <span class="armCodeInline">mvns</span>
					which computes the Boolean not and <span class="armCodeInline">orr</span> which
					computes the Boolean or.
				</p>
				<h2 id="anotherfunction">
					4 Another Function</h2>
				<p>
					So, we now have a function which takes care of the GPIO pin function setting. We
					now need to make a function to turn a GPIO pin on or off. Rather than having one
					function for off and one function for on, it would be handy to have a single function
					which does either.</p>
				<p>
					We will make a function called SetGpio which takes a GPIO pin number as its first
					input in r0, and a value as its second in r1. If the value is 0 we will turn the
					pin off, and if it is not zero we will turn it on.</p>
				<p>
					Copy and paste the following code at the end of 'gpio.s'.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>

					SetGpio:<br />
					pinNum .req r0<br />

					to mean the register <span class="armCodeInline">reg</span>.</div>
				<p>
					Once again we need the <span class="armCodeInline">.globl</span> command and the
					label to make the function accessible from other files. This time we're going to
					use register aliases. Register aliases allow us to use a name other than just r0
					or r1 for registers. This may not be so important now, but it will prove invaluable
					when writing big methods later, and you should try to use aliases from now on. <span
						class="armCodeInline">pinNum .req r0</span> means that <span class="armCodeInline">pinNum</span>
					now means <span class="armCodeInline">r0</span> when used in instructions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Copy and paste the following code after the above.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					cmp pinNum,#53<br />
					movhi pc,lr<br />
					push {lr}<br />
					mov r2,pinNum<br />
					.unreq pinNum<br />
					pinNum .req r2<br />
					bl GetGpioAddress<br />
					gpioAddr .req r0<br />
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">.unreq alias</span> removes the alias <span class="armCodeInline">
						alias</span>.</div>
				<p>
					Like in SetGpioFunction the first thing we must do is check that we were actually
					given a valid pin number. We do this in exactly the same way by comparing <span class="armCodeInline">
						pinNum</span> (<span class="armCodeInline">r0</span>) with 53, and returning
					immediately if it is higher. Once again we wish to call GetGpioAddress, so we have
					to preserve <span class="armCodeInline">lr</span> by pushing it onto the stack,
					and to move <span class="armCodeInline">pinNum</span> to <span class="armCodeInline">
						r2</span>. We then use the <span class="armCodeInline">.unreq</span> statement
					to remove our alias from <span class="armCodeInline">r0</span>. Since the pin number
					is now stored in <span class="armCodeInline">r2</span> we want our alias to reflect
					this, so we remove the alias from <span class="armCodeInline">r0</span> and remake
					it on <span class="armCodeInline">r2</span>. You should always <span class="armCodeInline">
						.unreq</span> every alias as soon as it is done with, so that you cannot make
					the mistake of using it further down the code when it no longer exists.</p>
				<p>
					We then call GetGpioAddress, and we create an alias for <span class="armCodeInline">
						r0</span> to reflect this.</p>
				<p>
					Copy and paste the following code after the above.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					pinBank .req r3<br />
					lsr pinBank,pinNum,#5<br />
					lsl pinBank,#2<br />
					add gpioAddr,pinBank<br />
					.unreq pinBank<br />
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">lsr dst,src,#val</span> shifts the binary representation
					of the number in <span class="armCodeInline">src</span> right by <span class="armCodeInline">
						val</span>, but stores the result in <span class="armCodeInline">dst</span>.</div>
				<p>
					The GPIO controller has two sets of 4 bytes each for turning pins on and off. The
					first set in each case controls the first 32 pins, and the second set controls the
					remaining 22. In order to determine which set it is in, we need to divide the pin
					number by 32. Fortunately this is very easy, at it is the same as shifting the binary
					representation of the pin number right by 5 places. Hence, in this case I've named
					<span class="armCodeInline">r3</span> as <span class="armCodeInline">pinBank</span>
					and then computed <span class="armCodeInline">pinNum</span> &divide; 32. Since it
					is a set of 4 bytes, we then need to multiply the result of this by 4. This is the
					same as shifting the binary representation left by 2 places, which is the command
					that follows. You may wonder if we could just shift it right by 3 places, as we
					went right then left. This won't work however, as some of the answer may have been
					rounded away when we did &divide; 32 which may not be if we just &divide; 8.</p>
				<p>
					The result of this is that <span class="armCodeInline">gpioAddr</span> now contains
					either 20200000<sub>16</sub> if the pin number is 0-31, or 20200004<sub>16</sub>
					if the pin number is 32-53. This means if we add 28<sub>10</sub> we get the address
					for turning the pin on, and if we add 40<sub>10</sub> we get the address for turning
					the pin off. Since we are done with <span class="armCodeInline">pinBank</span>,
					I use <span class="armCodeInline">.unreq</span> immediately afterwards.</p>
				<p>
					Copy and paste the following code after the above.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					and pinNum,#31<br />
					setBit .req r3<br />
					mov setBit,#1<br />
					lsl setBit,pinNum<br />
					.unreq pinNum<br />
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">and reg,#val</span> computes the Boolean and function
					of the number in <span class="armCodeInline">reg</span> with <span class="armCodeInline">
						val</span>.</div>
				<p>
					This next part of the function is for generating a number with the correct bit set.
					For the GPIO controller to turn a pin on or off, we give it a number with a bit
					set in the place of the remainder of that pin's number divided by 32. For example,
					to set pin 16, we need a number with the 16th bit a 1. To set pin 45 we would need
					a number with the 13th bit 1 as 45 &divide; 32 = 1 remainder 13.</p>
				<p>
					The <span class="armCodeInline">and</span> command computes the remainder we need.
					How it does this is that the result of an and operation is a number with 1s in all
					binary digits which had 1s in both of the inputs, and 0s elsewhere. This is a fundamental
					binary operation, and is very quick. We have given it inputs of <span class="armCodeInline">
						pinNum</span> and 31<sub>10</sub> = 11111<sub>2</sub>. This means that the answer
					can only have 1 bits in the last 5 places, and so is definitely between 0 and 31.
					Specifically it only has 1s where there were 1s in <span class="armCodeInline">pinNum</span>'s
					last 5 places. This is the same as the remainder of a division by 32. It is no coincidence
					that 31 = 32 - 1.</p>
				<img src="images/binary3.png" alt="binary division example" />
				<p>
					The rest of this code simply uses this value to shift the number 1 left. This has
					the effect of creating the binary number we need.</p>
				<p>
					Copy and paste the following code after the above.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					teq pinVal,#0<br />
					.unreq pinVal<br />
					streq setBit,[gpioAddr,#40]<br />
					strne setBit,[gpioAddr,#28]<br />
					.unreq setBit<br />
					.unreq gpioAddr<br />
					pop {pc}<br />
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">teq reg,#val</span> checks if the number in <span class="armCodeInline">
						reg</span> is equal to <span class="armCodeInline">val</span>.</div>
				<p>
					This code ends the method. As stated before, we turn the pin off if pinVal is zero,
					and on otherwise. <span class="armCodeInline">teq</span> (test equal) is another
					comparison operation that can only be used to test for equality. It is similar to
					cmp but it does not work out which number is bigger. If all you wish to do is test
					if two numbers are the same, you can use <span class="armCodeInline">teq</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If <span class="armCodeInline">pinVal</span> is zero, we store the <span class="armCodeInline">
						setBit</span> at 40 away from the GPIO address, which we already know turns
					the pin off. Otherwise we store it at 28, which turns the pin on. Finally, we return
					by popping the <span class="armCodeInline">pc</span>, which sets it to the value
					that we stored when we pushed the link register.</p>
				<h2 id="newbeginning">
					5 A New Beginning</h2>
				<p>
					Finally, after all that work we have our GPIO functions. We now need to alter 'main.s'
					to use them. Since 'main.s' is now getting a lot bigger and more complicated, it is
					better design to split it into two sections. The '.init' we've been using so far is
					best kept as small as possible. We can change the code to reflect this easily.</p>
				<p>
					Insert the following just after <span class="armCodeInline">_start:</span> in main.s:</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					b main<br />
					<br />
					.section .text<br />
					main:<br />
					mov sp,#0x8000<br />
				</div>
				<p>
					The key change we have made here is to introduce the <span class="armCodeInline">.text</span>
					section. I have designed the makefile and linker scripts such that code in the .text
					section (which is the default section) is placed after the .init section which is placed at address 8000<sub>16</sub>.
					This is the default load address and gives us some
					space to store the stack. As the stack exists in memory, it has to have an address.
					The stack grows down memory, so that each new value is at a lower address, thus
					making the 'top' of the stack, the lowest address.
				</p>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>
					The 'ATAGs' section in the diagram is a place where information about the Raspberry
					Pi is stored such as how much memory it has, and what its default screen resolution
					is.</div>
				<img src="images/osLayout.png" alt="Layout diagram of operating system" />
				<p>
					Replace all the code that set the function of the GPIO pin with the following:</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					pinNum .req r0<br />
					pinFunc .req r1<br />
					mov pinNum,#16<br />
					mov pinFunc,#1<br />
					bl SetGpioFunction<br />
					.unreq pinNum<br />
					.unreq pinFunc<br />
				</div>
				<p>
					This code calls SetGpioFunction with the pin number 16 and the pin function code
					1. This has the effect of enabling output to the OK LED.</p>
				<p>
					Replace any code which turns the OK LED on with the following:</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					pinNum .req r0<br />
					pinVal .req r1<br />
					mov pinNum,#16<br />
					mov pinVal,#0<br />
					bl SetGpio<br />
					.unreq pinNum<br />
					.unreq pinVal<br />
				</div>
				<p>
					This code uses SetGpio to turn off GPIO pin 16, thus turning on the OK LED. If we
					instead used <span class="armCodeInline">mov pinVal,#1</span>, it would turn the
					LED off. Replace your old code to turn the LED off with that.</p>
				<h2 id="onwards">
					6 Onwards</h2>
				<p>
					Hopefully now, you should be able to test what you have made on the Raspberry Pi.
					We've done a large amount of code this time, so there is a lot that can go wrong.
					If it does, head to the troubleshooting page.</p>
				<p>
					When you get it working, congratulations. Although our operating system does nothing
					more than it did in <a href="ok02.html">Lesson 2: OK02</a>, we've learned a lot about
					functions and formatting, and we can now code new features much more quickly. It
					would be very simple now to make an Operating System that alters any GPIO register,
					which could be used to control hardware!</p>
				<p>
					In <a href="ok04.html">Lesson 4: OK04</a>, we will address our wait function, which
					is currently imprecise, so that we can gain better control over our LED, and ultimately
					over all of the GPIO pins.</p>
