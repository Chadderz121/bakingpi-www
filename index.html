					Welcome to Baking Pi: Operating Systems Development! Course by <a href="mailto:awc32@cam.ac.uk">Alex Chadwick</a>.</p>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>
					You can now help contribute to this tutorial on <a href="https://github.com/chadderz121/bakingpi-www">GitHub</a>.</div>
				<p>
					This website is here to guide you through the process of developing <em>very</em>
					basic operating systems on the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Raspberry Pi homepage">
						Raspberry Pi</a>! This website is aimed at people aged 16 and upwards, although
					younger readers may still find some of it accessible, particularly with assistance.
					More lessons may be added to this course in time.
				</p>
				<p>
					This course takes you through the basics of operating systems development in assembly
					code. I have tried not to assume any prior knowledge of operating systems development
					or assembly code. It may be helpful to have some programming experience, but the
					course should be accessible without.
					The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=72">Raspberry Pi forums</a> are full of friendly people ready to help you out if you run into trouble. This course is divided into a series of 'lessons'
					designed to be taken in order as below. Each 'lesson' includes some theory, and
					also a practical exercise, complete with a full answer.</p>
				<p>
					Rather than leading the reader through the full details of creating an Operating
					System, these tutorials focus on achieving a few common tasks separately. Hopefully,
					by the end, the reader should know enough about Operating Systems that they could
					try to put together everything they've learned and make one. Although the lessons
					are generally focused on creating very specific things, there is plenty of room
					to play with what you learn. Perhaps, after reading the lesson on functions, you
					imagine a better style of assembly code. Perhaps after the lessons on graphics you
					imagine a 3D operating system. Since this is an Operating Systems course, you will
					have the power to design things how you like. If you have an idea, try it! Computer
					Science is still a young subject, and so there is plenty left to discover!

					1 Requirements</h2>
				<p>
				<h3 id="hardware">
					1.1 Hardware</h3>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>
					This course has not yet been fully updated to work with the Raspberry Pi model 1 A+, model 1 B+
					, model 2 B, or Compute module. See the  <a href="https://github.com/chadderz121/bakingpi-www">GitHub</a>
					"Issues" page for early notes and details for these newer platforms.</div>
				<p>
					In order to complete this course you will need a Raspberry Pi model 1 A or model 1B with an SD card and
					power supply. It is helpful, but not necessary, for your Raspberry Pi to be able to
					be connected to a screen and keyboard.</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the "testing" Raspberry Pi used to test and run your operating system code, you
					also need a seperate development and support computer to write and assemble the operating system
					binaries on. There are three possibilities for a development system: Minimal, Second PC, and Pi-to-Pi.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Minimal</b>: The same Raspberry Pi you will use as the test system. For this type of development system you
					only need a second SD card with the Raspbian Linux OS, and a USB to SD card writer. You will boot
					your Pi with Raspbian SD card and the SD card writer attached to USB. Create your OS in Raspbian and write
					it to a second bare metal SDcard in the USB writer. Then power down, switch your Pi to boot from the bare metal
					OS SD card for testing. Then you would shut down again, switch back to the Raspbian Linux SD card
					to debug or continue development. This can be slow and painful, but does allow you to complete the
					course with the minimum of hardware and software.</P>
				<p>	
					<b>Second PC</b>: This configuration uses a second development computer running Linux, Microsoft Windows, or
					Mac OS X capable of writing to the type of SD card used by your Raspberry Pi. You create your bare
					metal OS on the development computer, write it to the SD card in the development computer, then move
					the SD card to the Pi for testing. With a second PC, just moving the SD card is more convenient than
					reconfiguring a single Pi over and over to be development, then test, then development again.</p>
				<p>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>Your Pi-to-Pi development system can be a Raspberry Pi 2B.</div>

					<b>Pi-to-Pi</b>: By far, the most convenient way to do rapid bare-metal OS development and testing is to
					directly connect two Raspberry Pi computers using a custom serial cable. This configuration takes
					the most work to setup, initially, but makes the development and test cycle almost effortless. For
					this configuration, you will need the bootloader05 bare metal OS from
					<a href="https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi/">David Welch's Raspberri Pi github repository</a>
					and to follow his excellent Pi-to-Pi serial cable construction and use documentation at
					<a href="https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi/tree/master/pitopi">David Welch's Pi to Pi github page</a></p>

				<h3 id="software">
					1.2 Software</h3>
				<p>
					In terms of software, you require a GNU compiler toolchain that targets ARMv6 processors.
					If you use the Minimal or Pi-to-Pi development environments, you will simply install the
					binutils and gcc development tool packages into your Raspbian Linux using the apt-get install
					command while connected to the Internet.</p>
				<p>
					If you use the Second PC development system configuration, you will install or build a set
					of tools, called a cross-compiler, on your development system. This cross-compiler converts
					your source code files into Raspberry Pi-compatible executable files which are placed on
					the bare metal SD card. The bare metal SD card is then transferred to the Raspberry Pi where
					the executable can be tested.</p>
				<p>
					You can find instruction for getting and building the cross-compiler toolchain on the
					<a href="downloads.html">Downloads Page</a>, along with model answers for all of the
					exercises.</p>
