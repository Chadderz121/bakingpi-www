				<p>
					Welcome to the Screen lesson series. In this series, you will learn how to control
					the screen using the Raspberry Pi in assembly code, starting at just displaying
					random data, then moving up to displaying a fixed image, displaying text and then
					formatting numbers into text. It is assumed that you have already completed the
					OK series, and so things covered in this series will not be repeated here.
				</p>
				<p>
					This first screen lesson teaches some basic theory about graphics, and then applies
					it to display a gradient pattern to the screen or TV.</p>
				<div class="ucampas-toc">

					1 Getting Started</h2>
				<p>
					It is expected that you have completed the OK series, and so functions in the 'gpio.s'
					file and 'systemTimer.s' file from that series will be called. If you do not have
					these files, or prefer to use a correct implementation, download the solution to
					OK05.s. The 'main.s' file from here will also be useful, up to and including <span
						class="armCodeInline">mov sp,#0x8000</span>. Please delete anything after that
					line.</p>

					2 Computer Graphics</h2>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>There are a few systems for representing colours as numbers. Here we focus on RGB systems, but HSL is another common system used.</p></div>
				<p>
					As you're hopefully beginning to appreciate, at a fundamental level, computers are
					very stupid. They have a limited number of instructions, almost exclusively to do
					with maths, and yet somehow they are capable of doing many things. The thing we
					currently wish to understand is how a computer could possibly put an image on the
					screen. How would we translate this problem into binary? The answer is relatively
					straightforward; we devise some system of numbering each colour, and then we store
					one number for every pixel on the screen. A pixel is a small dot on your screen.
					If you move very close, you will probably be able to make out individual pixels
					on your screen, and be able to see that every image is just made out of these
					pixels in combination.</p>
				<p>
					As the computer age advanced, people wanted more and more complicated graphics,
					and so the concept of a graphics card was invented. The graphics card is a secondary
					processor on your computer which only exists to draw images to the screen. It has
					the job of turning the pixel value information into light intensity levels to be
					transmitted to the screen. On modern computers, graphics cards can also do a lot
					more than that, such as drawing 3D graphics. In this tutorial however, we will just
					concentrate on the first use of graphics cards; getting pixel colours from memory
					out to the screen.</p>
				<p>
					One issue that is raised immediately by all this is the system we use for numbering
					colours. There are several choices, each producing outputs of different quality.
					I will outline a few here for completeness.</p>
				<div class="informationBox"><p>Although some images here have few colours they use a
				technique called spatial dithering. This allows them to still show a good representation
				of the image, with very few colours. Many early Operating Systems used this technique.</p></div>

					In this tutorial we shall use High Colour initially. As you can see form the image,
					it is produces clear, good quality images, but it doesn't take up as much space
					as True Colour. That said, for quite a small display of 800x600 pixels, it would
					still take just under 1 megabyte of space. It also has the advantage that the size
					is a multiple of a power of 2, which greatly reduces the complexity of getting information
					compared with True Colour.</p>
					<div class="informationBox">
						<p>
							Storing the frame buffer places a heavy memory burden on a computer. For this reason,
							early computers often cheated, by, for example, storing a screens worth of text,
							and just drawing each letter to the screen every time it is refreshed separately.</p></div>
				<p>
					The Raspberry Pi has a very special and rather odd relationship with it's graphics
					processor. On the Raspberry Pi, the graphics processor actually runs first, and
					is responsible for starting up the main processor. This is very unusual. Ultimately
					it doesn't make too much difference, but in many interactions, it often feels like
					the processor is secondary, and the graphics processor is the most important. The
					two communicate on the Raspberry Pi by what is called the 'mailbox'. Each can deposit
					mail for the other, which will be collected at some future point and then dealt
					with. We shall use the mailbox to ask the graphics processor for an address. The
					address will be a location to which we can write the pixel colour information for
					the screen, called a frame buffer, and the graphics card will regularly check this
					location, and update the pixels on the screen appropriately.

					3 Programming the Postman</h2>
					<div class="informationBox">
						<p>
							Message passing is quite a common way for components to communicate. Some Operating
							Systems use virtual message passing to allow programs to communicate.</p></div>
				<p>
					The first thing we are going to need to program is a 'postman'. This is just two
					methods: MailboxRead, reading one message from the mailbox channel in r0. and MailboxWrite,
					writing the value in the top 28 bits of r0 to the mailbox channel in r1. The Raspberry
					Pi has 7 mailbox channels for communication with the graphics processor, only the
					first of which is useful to us, as it is for negotiating the frame buffer.</p>
				<p>
					The following table and diagrams describe the operation of the mailbox.</p>

				<p>
					In order to send a message to a particular mailbox:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The sender waits until the Status field has a 0 in the top bit.</li>
					<li>The sender writes to Write such that the lowest 4 bits are the mailbox to write
						to, and the upper 28 bits are the message to write.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					In order to read a message:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The receiver waits until the Status field has a 0 in the 30th bit.</li>
					<li>The receiver reads from Read.</li>
					<li>The receiver confirms the message is for the correct mailbox, and tries again if
						not.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					If you're feeling particularly confident, you now have enough information to write
					the two methods we need. If not, read on.</p>
				<p>
					As always the first method I recommend you implement is one to get the address of
					the mailbox region.</p>

					.globl GetMailboxBase<br />
					GetMailboxBase:<br />
					ldr r0,=0x2000B880<br />
					mov pc,lr<br />
				</p></div>
				<p>
					The sending procedure is least complicated, so we shall implement this first. As
					your methods become more and more complicated, you will need to start planning them
					in advance. A good way to do this might be to write out a simple list of the steps
					that need to be done, in a fair amount of detail, like below.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Our input will be what to write (r0), and what mailbox to write it to (r1). We must
						validate this is by checking it is a real mailbox, and that the low 4 bits of the
						value are 0. Never forget to validate inputs.</li>
					<li>Use GetMailboxBase to retrieve the address.</li>
					<li>Read from the Status field.</li>
					<li>Check the top bit is 0. If not, go back to 3.</li>
					<li>Combine the value to write and the channel.</li>
					<li>Write to the Write.</li>

					4 My Dearest Graphics Processor</h2>
				<p>
					Through our new postman, we now have the ability to send a message to the graphics
					card. What should we send though? This was certainly a difficult question for me
					to find the answer to, as it isn't in any online manual that I have found. Nevertheless,
					by looking at the GNU/Linux for the Raspberry Pi, we are able to work out what we
					needed to send.</p>
					<div class="informationBox">
						<p>
							Since the RAM is shared between the graphics processor and the processor on the
							Pi, we can just send where to find our message. This is called DMA, many complicated
							devices use this to speed up access times.</p>
					</div>
				<p>
					The message is very simple. We describe the framebuffer we would like, and the graphics
					card either agrees to our request, in which case it sends us back a 0, and fills
					in a small questionnaire we make, or it sends back a non-zero number, in which case
					we know it is unhappy. Unfortunately, I have no idea what any of the other numbers
					it can send back are, nor what they mean, but only when it sends a zero it is happy.
					Fortunately it always seems to send a zero for sensible inputs, so we don't need
					to worry too much.</p>
				<p>
					For simplicity we shall design our request in advance, and store it in the .data
					section. In a file called 'framebuffer.s' place the following code:</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					.section .data<br />
					.align 4<br />
					.globl FrameBufferInfo
					<br />
					FrameBufferInfo:<br />
					.int 1024 /* #0 Physical Width */<br />
					.int 768 /* #4 Physical Height */<br />
					.int 1024 /* #8 Virtual Width */<br />
					.int 768 /* #12 Virtual Height */<br />
					.int 0 /* #16 GPU - Pitch */<br />
					.int 16 /* #20 Bit Depth */<br />
					.int 0 /* #24 X */<br />
					.int 0 /* #28 Y */<br />
					.int 0 /* #32 GPU - Pointer */<br />
					.int 0 /* #36 GPU - Size */<br />
				</div>
				<p>
					This is the format of our messages to the graphics processor. The first two words
					describe the physical width and height. The second pair is the virtual
					width and height. The framebuffer's width and height are the virtual width and height,
					and the GPU scales the framebuffer as need to fit the physical screen. The next word is
					one of the ones the GPU will fill in if it grants our request. It will be the number
					of bytes on each row of the frame buffer, in this case 2 &times; 1024 = 2048. The
					next word is how many bits to allocate to each pixel. Using a value of 16 means
					that the graphics processor uses High Colour mode described above. A value of 24
					would use True Colour, and 32 would use RGBA32. The next two words are x and y offsets,
					which mean the number of pixels to skip in the top left corner of the screen when
					copying the framebuffer to the screen. Finally, the last two words are filled in
					by the graphics processor, the first of which is the actual pointer to the frame
					buffer, and the second is the size of the frame buffer in bytes.</p>
				<div class="informationBox">
					<p>
						When working with devices using DMA, alignment constraints become very important.
						The GPU expects the message to be 16 byte aligned.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					I was very careful to include a <span class="armCodeInline">.align 4</span> here.
					As discussed before, this ensures the lowest 4 bits of the address of the next line
					are 0. Thus, we know for sure that FrameBufferInfo will be placed at an address
					we can send to the graphics processor, as our mailbox only sends values with the
					low 4 bits all 0.
				</p>
				<p>
					So, now that we have our message, we can write code to send it. The communication
					will go as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Write the address of FrameBufferInfo + 0x40000000 to mailbox 1. </li>
					<li>Read the result from mailbox 1. If it is not zero, we didn't ask for a proper frame
						buffer.</li>
					<li>Copy our images to the pointer, and they will appear on screen!</li></ol>
				<p>
					I've said something that I've not mentioned before in step 1. We have to add
					0x40000000 to the address of FrameBufferInfo before sending it. This is actually a
					special signal to the GPU of how it should write to the structure. If we just send
					the address, the GPU will write its response, but will not make sure we can see it
					by flushing its cache. The cache is a piece of memory where a processor stores values
					its working on before sending them to the RAM. By adding 0x40000000, we tell the GPU not
					to use its cache for these writes, which ensures we will be able to see the change.</p>
				<p>
					Since there is quite a lot going on there, it would be best to implement this as
					a function, rather than just putting the code into main.s. We shall write a function
					InitialiseFrameBuffer which does all this negotiation and returns the pointer to
					the frame buffer info data above, once it has a pointer in it. For ease, we should
					also make it so that the width, height and bit depth of the frame buffer are inputs
					to this method, so that it is easy to change in main.s without having to get into
					the details of the negotiation.</p>
				<p>
					Once again, let's write down in detail the steps we will have to take. If you're
					feeling confident, try writing the function straight away.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Validate our inputs.</li>
					<li>Write the inputs into the frame buffer.</li>
					<li>Send the address of the frame buffer + 0x40000000 to the mailbox.</li>
					<li>Receive the reply from the mailbox.</li>
					<li>If the reply is not 0, the method has failed. We should return 0 to indicate failure.</li>
					<li>Return a pointer to the frame buffer info.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Now we're getting into much bigger methods than before. Below is one implementation
					of the above.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
							.section .text<br />
							.globl InitialiseFrameBuffer<br />
							InitialiseFrameBuffer:<br />
							width .req r0<br />
							height .req r1<br />
							bitDepth .req r2<br />
							cmp width,#4096<br />
							cmpls height,#4096<br />
							cmpls bitDepth,#32<br />
							result .req r0<br />
							movhi result,#0<br />
							movhi pc,lr<br />
						</div>
						<p>
							This code checks that the width and height are less than or equal to 4096, and that
							the bit depth is less than or equal to 32. This is once again using a trick with
							conditional execution. Convince yourself that this works.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
							fbInfoAddr .req r3<br />
							push {lr}<br />
							ldr fbInfoAddr,=FrameBufferInfo<br />
							str width,[fbInfoAddr,#0]<br />
							str height,[fbInfoAddr,#4]<br />

					5 A Pixel Within a Row Within a Frame</h2>
				<p>
					So, we've now created our methods to communicate with the graphics processor. It
					should now be capable of giving us the pointer to a frame buffer we can draw graphics
					to. Let's draw something now.</p>
				<p>
					In this first example, we'll just draw consecutive colours to the screen. It won't
					look pretty, but at least it will be working. How we will do this is by setting
					each pixel in the framebuffer to a consecutive number, and continually doing so.</p>
				<p>
					Copy the following code to 'main.s' after <span class="armCodeInline">mov sp,#0x8000</span></p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					mov r0,#1024<br />
					mov r1,#768<br />
					mov r2,#16<br />
					bl InitialiseFrameBuffer<br />
				</div>
				<p>
					This code simply uses our InitialiseFrameBuffer method to create a frame buffer
					with width 1024, height 768, and bit depth 16. You can try different values in here
					if you wish, as long as you are consistent throughout the code. Since it's possible
					that this method can return 0 if the graphics processor did not give us a frame
					buffer, we had better check for this, and turn the OK LED on if it happens.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					teq r0,#0<br />
					bne noError$<br />
					<br />
					mov r0,#16<br />
					mov r1,#1<br />
					bl SetGpioFunction<br />
					mov r0,#16<br />
					mov r1,#0<br />
					bl SetGpio<br />
					<br />
					error$:<br />
					b error$<br />
					<br />
					noError$:<br />
					fbInfoAddr .req r4<br />
					mov fbInfoAddr,r0<br />
				</div>
				<p>
					Now that we have the frame buffer info address, we need to get the frame buffer
					pointer from it, and start drawing to the screen. We will do this using two loops,
					one going down the rows, and one going along the columns. On the Raspberry Pi, indeed
					in most applications, pictures are stored left to right then top to bottom, so we
					have to do the loops in the order I have said.</p>
				<div class="armCodeBlock"><p>
					render$:<br />
					<div class="indent"><p>
						fbAddr .req r3<br />
						ldr fbAddr,[fbInfoAddr,#32]<br />
						<br />
						colour .req r0<br />
						y .req r1<br />
						mov y,#768<br />
						drawRow$:<br />
						<div class="indent"><p>
							x .req r2<br />
							mov x,#1024<br />
							drawPixel$:<br />
							<div class="indent"><p>
								strh colour,[fbAddr]<br />
								add fbAddr,#2<br />
								sub x,#1<br />
								teq x,#0<br />
								bne drawPixel$<br />
							</div><p>
							<br />
							sub y,#1<br />
							add colour,#1<br />
							teq y,#0<br />
							bne drawRow$<br />
							<br />
						</div><p>
						b render$<br />
					</div><p>
					<br />
					.unreq fbAddr<br />
					.unreq fbInfoAddr<br />
				</div>
				<div class="commandBox"><p>
					<span class="armCodeInline">strh reg,[dest]</span> stores the low half word number
					in <span class="armCodeInline">reg</span> at the address given by <span class="armCodeInline">
						dest</span>.</div>
				<p>
					This is quite a large chunk of code, and has a loop within a loop within a loop.
					To help get your head around the looping, I've indented the code which is looped,
					depending on which loop it is in. This is quite common in most high level programming
					languages, and the assembler simply ignores the tabs. We see here that I load in
					the frame buffer address from the frame buffer information structure, and then loop
					over every row, then every pixel on the row. At each pixel, I use an <span class="armCodeInline">
						strh</span> (store half word) command to store the current colour, then increment
					the address we're writing to. After drawing each row, we increment the colour that
					we are drawing. After drawing the full screen, we branch back to the beginning.</p>

					6 Seeing the Light</h2>
				<p>
					Now you're ready to test this code on the Raspberry Pi. You should
					see a changing gradient pattern. Be careful: until the first message is sent to the mailbox, the Raspberry Pi
					displays a still gradient pattern between the four corners.
					If it doesn't work, please see our troubleshooting page.
				</p>
				<p>
					If it does work, congratulations! You can now control the screen! Feel free to alter
					this code to draw whatever pattern you like. You can do some very nice gradient
					patterns, and can compute the value of each pixel directly, since <span class="armCodeInline">
						y</span> contains a y-coordinate for the pixel, and <span class="armCodeInline">x</span>
					contains an x-coordinate. In the next lesson, <a href="screen02.html">Lesson 7: Screen
						02</a>, we will look at one of the most common drawing tasks, lines.
